      " Harshal Patel to Bumrah, no run, now he almost gets a sixth with an inswinging yorker, Bumrah couldn't squeeze it. Ball was just outside off stump, AB threw the ball onto the sticks, ball ricochets and decide against stealing run \n",
      " Harshal Patel to Marco Jansen, out Bowled!! One ball later but he has a five-wicket haul. Harshal Patel with an inswinging yorker that smashes the sticks. Wow! Kohli is delighted. All those worried about RCB's death bowling will be happy to see this. Jansen obviously not well equipped to dig this out, loses the off stick and walks back. Marco Jansen b Harshal Patel 0(2) \n",
      " Harshal Patel to Marco Jansen, no run, oh almost bowled! Jansen backed away and missed this dipping slower ball yorker \n",
      " Jamieson to Pollard, no run, beaten! Pollard not picking slower balls, swings early and misses \n",
      " Jamieson to Krunal Pandya, no run, brilliant yorker and the bat is in two pieces. Pandya swung, the handle is in the hands, but the rest of the willow broke and fell to ground. Proud moment for a bowler. Krunal sees the funny side of it \n",
      " Jamieson to Krunal Pandya, 1 run, dropped! But is Kohli okay? Looks like the ball burst through his hands and hit him on the face. Thankfully just under his right eye. Was too casual for the catch. He switches position but doesn't go off. Brings out the smile to the relief of the RCB fans. So this was a full ball in the slot, Pandya smashed it hard. Kohli moved to the left, tried to go reverse cup style and spilled the catch \n",
      " Harshal Patel to Ishan Kishan, out Lbw!! One of those rare errors from Nitin. He thought the ball pitched outside leg, but the replay confirms it was in line with leg stump. Kishan going too far across the line to play that stylish bottom hand whip, misses the ball completely, impact in line with middle and smashing the poles. Harshal Patel was surprised the decision wasn't given and immediately showed the thums up to his captain to say that was out. Good review from RCB. Ishan Kishan lbw b Harshal Patel 28(19) [4s-2 6s-1] \n",
      " Harshal Patel to Pollard, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Pollard punches to the left of the bowler \n",

      " Siraj to Pollard, no run, short of length delivery, Pollard knocks it to leg. Nicely bowled, pace off and Pollard had to adjust the defence \n",
      " Siraj to Pollard, no run, big Polly won't like that! Siraj bowls a short delivery, Pollard tries to baack away and gets hit on the right chest. That must have woken him up surely \n",
      " Siraj to Ishan Kishan, wide, nope! A ball down leg side will have to be rebowled \n",
      "Harshal Patel to Hardik Pandya, out Lbw!! Hardik Pandya out to a full toss in this format. Can you imagine? But full credit to Harshal Patel for taking pace off. Pandya played for normal pace and fell over slightly trying the flick, the ball came slow and the impact was in line with leg stump. Hardik was across the stumps to make like easy for umpire Nitin Menon, but you don't need external help if you are Nitin Menon. Been top class with his umpiring. Hardik Pandya lbw b Harshal Patel 13(10) [4s-2]\n",

Pandya smashes this overpitched freebie, the ball escaped Christian's hands as he went reverse cup. Thankfully no damage done \n",
      " Christian to Hardik Pandya, no run, short of length and rushing Pandya on the cross-batted swipe, hit on the thigh pad \n",
      " Chahal to Ishan Kishan, SIX, a delight to watch clean-hitters in this format. Chahal trying to push this wide on seeing Kishan advance, but Kishan ushed his reach to loft this handsomely into the black sightscreen \n",
      " Chahal to Hardik Pandya, 1 run, risky! But he escapes. Pandya blocked this off the front foot to the right of the bowler, Chahal attacked with the slide and fired the throw but it was wide. Flings his left elbow in mild pain as he landed badly. Is fine to carry on \n",
      " Washington Sundar to Ishan Kishan, no run, tries to flick, wears it on the pad, going down \n",
      " Siraj to Chris Lynn, no run, oh beat him for pace! An Indian pacer beats a bloke who plays at the Gabba for pace on a sluggish pitch! Wow! Fullish and outside off stump, Lynn was late in coming forward, lucky didn't edge this to ABdV \n",
      " Siraj to Ishan Kishan, no run, oh Kishan looks to defend and gets hit high on the bat. This is playing slightly up and down, so won't be easy to hit straightaway unless dew sets in \n",
      " Siraj to Chris Lynn, 1 run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Lynn pushes it along the ground for a run \n",

      " Jamieson to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, that's it! That the zone. Jamieson feeding a leg stump ball on length, SKY loves to use his wrists, flicks it aerial and doesn't mind the fielder in the deep. Clears quite comfortably \n",
      "Chahal to Chris Lynn, no run, back of a length on off, flat through the air, Lynn blocks from the crease\n",
      " Chahal to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, goes for the sweep again, with the ball this time deflecting fine off the pad past leg stump as Chahal fires it through. The umpire gives it runs, maybe an edge was involved too \n",

      " Chahal to Rohit, 1 run, nudged into the on-side \n",
      " Chahal to Chris Lynn, no run, pushes it through flat on middle stump. It's a length ball that slides through and Lynn watches it cautiously in defence \n",

      " Siraj to Rohit, no run, indications of the pace of this surface, and the bounce. Back of a length, probably wasn't there to pull in any case. Rohit goes for it but the ball sneaks under him and strikes him on the thigh \n",
      " Marco Jansen to Siraj, leg byes, 1 run, shuffles, misses his glance, but the ball trickles away just past the stumps, and that's good enough to pinch the leg bye \n",
      " Marco Jansen to de Villiers, 1 run, ah, well, well, well. Proper yorker this -- pacy, just outside off and de Villiers throws his bat out at it after making his usual room, and can only squirt it off the inside-toe-end past his stumps \n",

      " Bumrah to de Villiers, 1 run, 142.2kph, nails the yorker now. On middle. Jammed. Leg-side. Quick single .. 8 runs | 8 balls  \n",
      " Boult to Jamieson, 1 run, a cramped swivel-pull, inside-halving it round the corner \n",
      " Bumrah to Jamieson, no run, nipping in on middle, length, tight. Jabbed away to leg \n",
      " Bumrah to Christian, no run, 145.1kph, another proper mother of yorkers. It's an achievement when you don't end up bowled on these. Christian digs it out \n",
      " Rahul Chahar to de Villiers, 1 run, looks to paddle, but misses and Kishan cops a blow on his helmet \n",
      " Marco Jansen to de Villiers, no run, 133.3kph, proper yorker, tailing in on leg-stump. Somehow, somehow jammed out to leg \n",
      " Marco Jansen to Shahbaz Ahmed, wide, full, angling in, and continues angling down leg \n",
      " Rahul Chahar to Kohli, no run, proper drag down this. But somehow, Kohli's missed it. Blame the lack of bounce, sneaking under his bat, with some sharp spin on it as well to get it wide of off-stump \n",
      " Krunal Pandya to Kohli, 1 run, another step out, but a room-making one, freeing up his hands and slapping it to sweeper in the deep \n",
      " Krunal Pandya to Maxwell, 1 run, flatter, on off, a backing-away slice through sweeper \n",
      " Marco Jansen to Maxwell, wide, goes short and sprays it well wide of off once again, wided \n",
      " Krunal Pandya to Maxwell, FOUR, the inside out special once again from Maxwell! Unfurls those whippy wrists to get under the full delivery and times it to perfection over the fielder. No chance for the fielders in the deep \n",
      " Krunal Pandya to Maxwell, no run, bowls the slider on the pads and Maxwell couldn't put it away, jumps back in the crease and gets hit high on the pad \n",
      " Krunal Pandya to Maxwell, no run, quicker on the stumps, played back to the bowler \n",
      " Rahul Chahar to Maxwell, no run, quicker and spinning into the pads, Maxwell looks to flick and misses. Hit high on the front pad \n",
      " Boult to Rajat Patidar, out Bowled!! Boult picked wickets for fun in the last IPL and he's happy to continue that momentum this season. Bowled a string of dots to the IPL debutant and now goes for the variation, the knuckle ball. Patidar was stuck inside the crease and wasn't really coming towards the line of the delivery, pokes away from his body and gets a thick inside edge back onto his off-stump Rajat Patidar b Boult 8(8) [4s-1] \n",

      " Boult to Washington Sundar, no run, 138ks draws Sundar into a drive and beats the outside edge. On and around good length and Sundar's feet went nowhere on the attempted drive \n",
      " Boult to Washington Sundar, 1 run, drop-and-run single. Smart cricket from RCB. Sundar tapped this good length delivery with soft hands and Kohli was keen on nabbing a quick single, made it look very easy in the end \n",
      " Bumrah to Washington Sundar, no run, seam-up delivery nips back in from a good length to strike Sundar high on the pad as he misses the flick on the leg-side \n",
      " Boult to Washington Sundar, 5 wides, full and well down the leg-side, has that been deflected off the pads? The umpire doesn't think so. The scrambled seam full delivery sprayed down the leg-side, Ishan Kishan put in a full length dive to his right but couldn't get anywhere close \n",
