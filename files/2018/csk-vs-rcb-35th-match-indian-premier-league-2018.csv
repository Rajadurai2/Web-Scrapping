19.6," Dwayne Bravo to Siraj, out Siraj Run Out!! 1 run completed A wicket to cap the innings. Full toss that Siraj mistimed towards long-on and they were going for the second run. Had to with this being the last ball but Rayudu's throw at the keeper's end was on target. Dhoni whipped off the bails in a flash and even the dive couldn't save Siraj. RCB end with an underwhelming total.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.

There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

RCB have a 4-1 record at this venue while CSK stand at 3-2.  Interesting face-offs  MS Dhoni has scored the most runs by any player against RCB in IPL - 678.

Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.  IPL 2018 trends  CSK & RCB have been the two poorest sides when it comes to death bowling economy rates - 11.63 & 12.68 respectively.  CSK has hit the most sixes this IPL for any side - 93.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.  Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Lungisani Ngidi, KM Asif  Royal Challengers Bangalore: AB de Villiers will slot in place of Quinton de Kock, who is away for a wedding. But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.  Predicted XI: Parthiv Patel/Manan Vohra, Brendon McCullum, Virat Kohli (C), AB de Villiers, Mandeep Singh, Colin de Grandhomme, Washington Sundar, Tim Southee, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Yuzvendra Chahal  What they said:  ""I think Colin did a great job in the last game. I think the 20-odd runs he scored was the reason why we won the game. Really satisfied with how Colin has come into the team. I think Mandeep has been consistent. Finishing plays a part when you don't do well at the top. We have done well at the top with the experienced four batsmen generally batting well."" - Daniel Vettori, RCB head coach.  Head to Head of teams  CSK 13 - 7 RCB  CSK have won all of the last five contests between the two teams.  Team Record in Pune  This is the first time the two teams will play in Pune. RCB have a 4-1 record at this venue while CSK stand at 3-2.  Interesting face-offs  MS Dhoni has scored the most runs by any player against RCB in IPL - 678. Raina is third in this list with 617 runs.  Kohli has scored more runs against CSK than any other player - 724 runs at 42.59 with a SR of 126.80.  Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.  IPL 2018 trends  CSK & RCB have been the two poorest sides when it comes to death bowling economy rates - 11.63 & 12.68 respectively.  CSK has hit the most sixes this IPL for any side - 93.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for.

Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

RCB have a 4-1 record at this venue while CSK stand at 3-2.  Interesting face-offs  MS Dhoni has scored the most runs by any player against RCB in IPL - 678.

Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.  IPL 2018 trends  CSK & RCB have been the two poorest sides when it comes to death bowling economy rates - 11.63 & 12.68 respectively.  CSK has hit the most sixes this IPL for any side - 93.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers.

CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers.

The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total.

Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.  Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Lungisani Ngidi, KM Asif  Royal Challengers Bangalore: AB de Villiers will slot in place of Quinton de Kock, who is away for a wedding. But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.  Predicted XI: Parthiv Patel/Manan Vohra, Brendon McCullum, Virat Kohli (C), AB de Villiers, Mandeep Singh, Colin de Grandhomme, Washington Sundar, Tim Southee, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Yuzvendra Chahal  What they said:  ""I think Colin did a great job in the last game. I think the 20-odd runs he scored was the reason why we won the game. Really satisfied with how Colin has come into the team. I think Mandeep has been consistent. Finishing plays a part when you don't do well at the top. We have done well at the top with the experienced four batsmen generally batting well."" - Daniel Vettori, RCB head coach.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total.

They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.  When: May 5, 2018, 4 PM IST - Chennai Super Kings vs Royal Challengers Bangalore  Where: Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune  What to expect: The heat will test the players with the temperature expected to hover around 40 degree Celsius.

Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.  Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Lungisani Ngidi, KM Asif  Royal Challengers Bangalore: AB de Villiers will slot in place of Quinton de Kock, who is away for a wedding. But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.

But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Raina is third in this list with 617 runs.  Kohli has scored more runs against CSK than any other player - 724 runs at 42.59 with a SR of 126.80.  Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.  IPL 2018 trends  CSK & RCB have been the two poorest sides when it comes to death bowling economy rates - 11.63 & 12.68 respectively.  CSK has hit the most sixes this IPL for any side - 93.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers.

There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers.

CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

Judging by the results so far, the wicket is likely to be a batting beauty.  Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.  Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Lungisani Ngidi, KM Asif  Royal Challengers Bangalore: AB de Villiers will slot in place of Quinton de Kock, who is away for a wedding. But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.

But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.

It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers.

CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Raina is third in this list with 617 runs.  Kohli has scored more runs against CSK than any other player - 724 runs at 42.59 with a SR of 126.80.  Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.  IPL 2018 trends  CSK & RCB have been the two poorest sides when it comes to death bowling economy rates - 11.63 & 12.68 respectively.  CSK has hit the most sixes this IPL for any side - 93.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Judging by the results so far, the wicket is likely to be a batting beauty.  Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.  Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Lungisani Ngidi, KM Asif  Royal Challengers Bangalore: AB de Villiers will slot in place of Quinton de Kock, who is away for a wedding. But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.  Predicted XI: Parthiv Patel/Manan Vohra, Brendon McCullum, Virat Kohli (C), AB de Villiers, Mandeep Singh, Colin de Grandhomme, Washington Sundar, Tim Southee, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Yuzvendra Chahal  What they said:  ""I think Colin did a great job in the last game. I think the 20-odd runs he scored was the reason why we won the game. Really satisfied with how Colin has come into the team. I think Mandeep has been consistent. Finishing plays a part when you don't do well at the top. We have done well at the top with the experienced four batsmen generally batting well."" - Daniel Vettori, RCB head coach.  Head to Head of teams  CSK 13 - 7 RCB  CSK have won all of the last five contests between the two teams.  Team Record in Pune  This is the first time the two teams will play in Pune. RCB have a 4-1 record at this venue while CSK stand at 3-2.  Interesting face-offs  MS Dhoni has scored the most runs by any player against RCB in IPL - 678. Raina is third in this list with 617 runs.  Kohli has scored more runs against CSK than any other player - 724 runs at 42.59 with a SR of 126.80.  Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.  IPL 2018 trends  CSK & RCB have been the two poorest sides when it comes to death bowling economy rates - 11.63 & 12.68 respectively.  CSK has hit the most sixes this IPL for any side - 93.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.

Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total.

But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less.

The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.  When: May 5, 2018, 4 PM IST - Chennai Super Kings vs Royal Challengers Bangalore  Where: Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune  What to expect: The heat will test the players with the temperature expected to hover around 40 degree Celsius.

Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.  Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Lungisani Ngidi, KM Asif  Royal Challengers Bangalore: AB de Villiers will slot in place of Quinton de Kock, who is away for a wedding. But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.

They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.  Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Lungisani Ngidi, KM Asif  Royal Challengers Bangalore: AB de Villiers will slot in place of Quinton de Kock, who is away for a wedding. But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.

But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.

RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.  Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Lungisani Ngidi, KM Asif  Royal Challengers Bangalore: AB de Villiers will slot in place of Quinton de Kock, who is away for a wedding. But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Head to Head of teams  CSK 13 - 7 RCB  CSK have won all of the last five contests between the two teams.  Team Record in Pune  This is the first time the two teams will play in Pune. RCB have a 4-1 record at this venue while CSK stand at 3-2.  Interesting face-offs  MS Dhoni has scored the most runs by any player against RCB in IPL - 678. Raina is third in this list with 617 runs.  Kohli has scored more runs against CSK than any other player - 724 runs at 42.59 with a SR of 126.80.  Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.  IPL 2018 trends  CSK & RCB have been the two poorest sides when it comes to death bowling economy rates - 11.63 & 12.68 respectively.  CSK has hit the most sixes this IPL for any side - 93.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.

I think the 20-odd runs he scored was the reason why we won the game. Really satisfied with how Colin has come into the team. I think Mandeep has been consistent.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.

Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total.

While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

Raina is third in this list with 617 runs.  Kohli has scored more runs against CSK than any other player - 724 runs at 42.59 with a SR of 126.80.  Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.  IPL 2018 trends  CSK & RCB have been the two poorest sides when it comes to death bowling economy rates - 11.63 & 12.68 respectively.  CSK has hit the most sixes this IPL for any side - 93.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.

Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season.

Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for.

Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for.

Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.  Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Lungisani Ngidi, KM Asif  Royal Challengers Bangalore: AB de Villiers will slot in place of Quinton de Kock, who is away for a wedding. But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.

While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.  When: May 5, 2018, 4 PM IST - Chennai Super Kings vs Royal Challengers Bangalore  Where: Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune  What to expect: The heat will test the players with the temperature expected to hover around 40 degree Celsius. Judging by the results so far, the wicket is likely to be a batting beauty.  Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.  Predicted XI: Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Karn Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Lungisani Ngidi, KM Asif  Royal Challengers Bangalore: AB de Villiers will slot in place of Quinton de Kock, who is away for a wedding. But the chances of de Villiers or Brendon McCullum keeping wickets appear to be very less. Parthiv Patel was seen having a long session at the nets and he might come in place of Manan Vohra despite the opener's 31-ball 45 against MI.

It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers.

CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Raina is third in this list with 617 runs.  Kohli has scored more runs against CSK than any other player - 724 runs at 42.59 with a SR of 126.80.  Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.  IPL 2018 trends  CSK & RCB have been the two poorest sides when it comes to death bowling economy rates - 11.63 & 12.68 respectively.  CSK has hit the most sixes this IPL for any side - 93.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.

CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Head to Head of teams  CSK 13 - 7 RCB  CSK have won all of the last five contests between the two teams.  Team Record in Pune  This is the first time the two teams will play in Pune. RCB have a 4-1 record at this venue while CSK stand at 3-2.  Interesting face-offs  MS Dhoni has scored the most runs by any player against RCB in IPL - 678. Raina is third in this list with 617 runs.  Kohli has scored more runs against CSK than any other player - 724 runs at 42.59 with a SR of 126.80.  Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.  IPL 2018 trends  CSK & RCB have been the two poorest sides when it comes to death bowling economy rates - 11.63 & 12.68 respectively.  CSK has hit the most sixes this IPL for any side - 93.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.

Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other.

Head to Head of teams  CSK 13 - 7 RCB  CSK have won all of the last five contests between the two teams.  Team Record in Pune  This is the first time the two teams will play in Pune. RCB have a 4-1 record at this venue while CSK stand at 3-2.  Interesting face-offs  MS Dhoni has scored the most runs by any player against RCB in IPL - 678. Raina is third in this list with 617 runs.  Kohli has scored more runs against CSK than any other player - 724 runs at 42.59 with a SR of 126.80.  Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.  IPL 2018 trends  CSK & RCB have been the two poorest sides when it comes to death bowling economy rates - 11.63 & 12.68 respectively.  CSK has hit the most sixes this IPL for any side - 93.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

Predicted XI: Parthiv Patel/Manan Vohra, Brendon McCullum, Virat Kohli (C), AB de Villiers, Mandeep Singh, Colin de Grandhomme, Washington Sundar, Tim Southee, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Yuzvendra Chahal  What they said:  ""I think Colin did a great job in the last game. I think the 20-odd runs he scored was the reason why we won the game. Really satisfied with how Colin has come into the team. I think Mandeep has been consistent. Finishing plays a part when you don't do well at the top. We have done well at the top with the experienced four batsmen generally batting well."" - Daniel Vettori, RCB head coach.  Head to Head of teams  CSK 13 - 7 RCB  CSK have won all of the last five contests between the two teams.  Team Record in Pune  This is the first time the two teams will play in Pune.

Venue trends  The average scoring rate in the three games at this venue is 9.24 - the highest for any venue this IPL which has hosted at least two games.

They are still second on the points table, are on course to make it to the playoffs once again and they have also been involved in some dramatic finishes, holding their nerve which will keep them in good stead going forward. It might not be the perfect season, winning six and losing three so far, but it's a position Virat Kohli would have loved Royal Challengers Bangalore to be in.  RCB was brimming with confidence with the skipper himself declaring the squad to be perfect on all fronts (especially the bowling attack) ahead of the season. But they started their campaign with a loss, got savaged a few times, endured a few heartbreaking losses, had to deal with AB de Villiers getting sidelined at a crunch situation and now find themselves needing at least five wins out of their remaining six games.  They have been handed a much-needed boost ahead of the clash against CSK with de Villiers returning to the side but RCB will want more from their finishers. While Mandeep Singh has been pretty consistent, Colin de Grandhomme's cameo was vital against Mumbai Indians the other night. The duo will have to come good in tandem against an attack that's been struggling at the death.  CSK injected pace into their bowling lineup by bringing in Lungisani Ngidi and KM Asif but both were taken to the cleaners after looking good earlier with the new ball during the loss to KKR. There will be some concern surrounding Ravindra Jadeja's role as well. Dhoni continues to trust Jadeja with the bat, evidenced by his promotion ahead of Dwayne Bravo in most of the games but the Saurashtra allrounder is clearly lacking in confidence after finding it hard to come up with vital cameos that he was once renowned for. It's also taken a hit on his bowling and surprisingly on his fielding as well, after he dropped two catches off successive deliveries against KKR on Thursday.  Quite bizarrely, Karn Sharma, who has come in place of Imran Tahir has been under-bowled. In the four matches he has played so far, Karn has only bowled 5.3 overs in total. Perhaps, introducing a wicket-taking option much earlier can ease CSK's burden at the death. For now, both sides might look up to their batting might to overpower the other. With the surface in Pune producing big runs so far, another high-scoring south Indian derby is on the cards.

Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Unless there is a need to give a break to one or two players owing to the tight schedule, CSK will largely remain unchanged despite the loss.
