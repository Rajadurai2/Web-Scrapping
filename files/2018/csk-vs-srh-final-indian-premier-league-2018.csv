Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

What they said:  ""Look I think we can all recall the last game we played. We could have won that game by 20 runs or lost it as we did. It was a remarkable comeback from CSK. I guess we got 90 percent of that game right and you got to give credit where it’s due. Faf played a remarkable innings and showed his class and experience to be able to see it right to the end.

Dhoni vs Bhuvneshwar: Dhoni has scored 87 runs off Bhuvneshwar from just 52 balls at a SR of 167.30 - the most scored off the right-arm seamer by a player without getting dismissed.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

What they said:  ""Look I think we can all recall the last game we played. We could have won that game by 20 runs or lost it as we did. It was a remarkable comeback from CSK. I guess we got 90 percent of that game right and you got to give credit where it’s due. Faf played a remarkable innings and showed his class and experience to be able to see it right to the end.

He has been MoM in both games in the league phase against SRH.  Dhoni vs Bhuvneshwar: Dhoni has scored 87 runs off Bhuvneshwar from just 52 balls at a SR of 167.30 - the most scored off the right-arm seamer by a player without getting dismissed.

SRH are the only side to defend totals less than 150 thrice while CSK are the only side to chase down 180+ targets thrice.","Preview by Vishaal Loganathan  Here we are. 59 matches done. 10 venues as hosts. Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names.

They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.  The final is at stake and the sub-plots already look delightful. It has been one hell of an IPL, and it could just have the explosive finish it deserves.

Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011.

For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions.

Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.

What they said:  ""Look I think we can all recall the last game we played. We could have won that game by 20 runs or lost it as we did. It was a remarkable comeback from CSK. I guess we got 90 percent of that game right and you got to give credit where it’s due. Faf played a remarkable innings and showed his class and experience to be able to see it right to the end.

Dhoni vs Bhuvneshwar: Dhoni has scored 87 runs off Bhuvneshwar from just 52 balls at a SR of 167.30 - the most scored off the right-arm seamer by a player without getting dismissed.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.  The final is at stake and the sub-plots already look delightful. It has been one hell of an IPL, and it could just have the explosive finish it deserves.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.

They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.

They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays.

They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011.

For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions.

It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.

Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names.

They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.  The final is at stake and the sub-plots already look delightful. It has been one hell of an IPL, and it could just have the explosive finish it deserves.

Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011.

It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.

Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names.

They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.  The final is at stake and the sub-plots already look delightful. It has been one hell of an IPL, and it could just have the explosive finish it deserves.

IPL 2018 trends  CSK are the best batting side in the tournament with the highest average of 35.04 per wicket combined with a scoring rate of 8.92 (second best behind DD's 9.10).

SRH are the only side to defend totals less than 150 thrice while CSK are the only side to chase down 180+ targets thrice.","Preview by Vishaal Loganathan  Here we are. 59 matches done. 10 venues as hosts. Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.

Thousands of miles covered. 149 players fighting tooth and nail to enable their team a shot at the trophy. There were mighty tugs of war - this IPL will perhaps be remembered most for how deep it went and how competitive most of its matches were. 50 days since the start, only two teams remain - Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad - leaving 22 players and a few substitutes their last chance at glory in IPL 2018.  Chennai Super Kings have made a habit of appearing in IPL finals, even if they haven't really made winning the final a habit. They are in their seventh IPL final in nine attempts, having won two, back-to-back, in 2010 and 2011. They were away on a two-year hiatus, and to return to the competition with a triumph will be a statement of sorts for CSK.  For SRH, it will be the culmination of years of meticulous planning and execution. Including this year, they have made the playoffs on three consecutive occasions. Possessing a strong bowling attack already, they strengthened it further this season by adding a few more names. It is no surprise now that their attack is the most lethal and constantly wins them games that people think are beyond them.  As has been the trend this IPL, the tug of war is set to continue into the final games. The match-ups between players from both sides make for a mouth-watering contest. Kane Williamson and MS Dhoni take on each other as not only captains leading from the front, but also as middle order mainstays. Rashid Khan faces the experienced batting order that has gotten the better of him thrice (His 2-11 in four overs in the last game not enough to help SRH win) already. Lungi Ngidi goes up against Shikhar Dhawan, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar will have to tackle two international stars in Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson.  The final is at stake and the sub-plots already look delightful. It has been one hell of an IPL, and it could just have the explosive finish it deserves.

Expect more of the same on Sunday. Weatherwise, a cloudy, humid evening with a slight chance of rain.  Team News:  Chennai Super Kings: Expect Dhoni's side not to go in with any changes. Harbhajan could be given a bigger role, he did not bowl at all in the last game, given how the pitch will behave. Karn Sharma has an outside chance, should CSK look at beefing their spin department.

I guess we got 90 percent of that game right and you got to give credit where it’s due. Faf played a remarkable innings and showed his class and experience to be able to see it right to the end.
