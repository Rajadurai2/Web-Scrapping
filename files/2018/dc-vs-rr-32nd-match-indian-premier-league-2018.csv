17.1," Jofra Archer to Maxwell, out Lbw!! Needless review from Maxwell and he has to go. Pinpoint yorker from Archer and the Australian couldn't get his bat down on time. Pinned on the back pad and it rolled towards short fine leg. Umpire Nandan was quick to raise his finger and so was Maxwell to signal the T. That suggested that perhaps he might have got some bat on it but no, replays clearly show he hadn't and the rest is just a formality. Three Reds on HawkEye. It's started to rain as well!!!

14.6," Unadkat to Pant, out Caught by Stokes!! Vital, vital breakthrough! Might easily make a difference of about 10-15 runs to the eventual total. The deadly Pant has to depart but not before he has produced another thrill-a-minute epic. Backed away to make room for the big shot but one hand comes off in the process. Didn't get hold of it and skied this high towards long-on where Stokes moved to his left a fair bit to judge the skier perfectly.

14.3," Unadkat to Shreyas Iyer, out Caught by R Tripathi!! Finally, a wicket for RR! Some respite from the carnage but it's not the man they would have wanted although Iyer also was striking them really well. Slower ball from Unadkat and the length is a touch shorter, the DD captain wanted to launch down the ground but only got height on this one. Went up to the night sky for ages towards long-off where Tripathi held his nerve to settle under it.
