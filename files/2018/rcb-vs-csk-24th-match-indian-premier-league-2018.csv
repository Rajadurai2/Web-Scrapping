But deserved wicket for him and credit to MS too for giving the field to him. Wanted Tahir to toss it up outside off, out of de Villiers's reach. Must have expected de Villiers to go for it after just four came off the last ten balls. And it works. de Villiers wants to go in-to-out, but the spin away forces the miscue, and they have one of the best fielders in the team in Billings at deep cover, running in to settle under that.
