A spike on the UltraEdge and Rinku Singh is gone. A very faint one that and hard to spot amidst the fuzzy environment. The decision has been reversed. OUT. This is a classic case of both batsman and bowler refusing to alter their plans. Woakes dished out a short ball and made life difficult for Rinku Singh by cutting it across him, the angle was always going against him. He ran down the pitch and fed a faint nick on the pull.
