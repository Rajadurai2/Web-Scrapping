18.6," Prasidh to Unadkat, out Bowled!! RR won't play out their quota of overs. That was a slower delivery and the batsman went for the slog sweep but was outdone by the lack of pace on it. The batsman knelt down, may be guessed the pace right, but could not connect at all for the LED bails to lighten up. KKR camp is chuffed. So is the crowd and the entire team. The on-field umpire did check for a no-ball but it is KKR's evening and nothing can go wrong. Unadkat b Prasidh 26(18) [4s-3 6s-1] ",1st Inns,49t,Kolkata Knight Riders,Rajasthan Royals,"Kolkata Knight Riders (Playing XI): Chris Lynn, Sunil Narine, Robin Uthappa, Andre Russell, Dinesh Karthik(w/c), Nitish Rana, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, Prasidh Krishna, Shivam Mavi, Kuldeep Yadav","Rajasthan Royals (Playing XI): Jos Buttler(w), Ajinkya Rahane(c), Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Rahul Tripathi, Stuart Binny, Jofra Archer, Krishnappa Gowtham, Jaydev Unadkat, Ish Sodhi, Anureet Singh"," Preview by Akash Sarkar   Rajasthan Royals land in Kolkata on the back of three consecutive, dominating and extremely impressive wins. Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late.

Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour. Just one spot is likely to be debated in the team meeting but it's highly likely they will go in with an unchanged XI.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).  In the five matches in May, Buttler has scored 48.38% of the total runs RR have made in the five games (389/804).

KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations.

IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).  In the five matches in May, Buttler has scored 48.38% of the total runs RR have made in the five games (389/804).  Russell has a strike rate of 196.15 against pace this IPL but has got out to pace nine times. In comparison, he has faced only 31 deliveries of spin without getting dismissed but strikes at only 145.16 against them.  What they said:  ""We haven't looked at other teams.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability.

IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).  In the five matches in May, Buttler has scored 48.38% of the total runs RR have made in the five games (389/804).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done.

Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business.

The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business.

10.3," Narine to Samson, out Lbw!! The flattish ball spun in sharply and hit the batsman high on the back leg. Looks a little high. Was there an inside edge? NO! The height is not an issue. Three Reds. RR are going down like a lead balloon. The ball skidded on and the batsman was late on the attempted swat on the on-side. This is tragedy for RR. From 59 in 4 overs to this.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour.

Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.

Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability.

Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now.

But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).  In the five matches in May, Buttler has scored 48.38% of the total runs RR have made in the five games (389/804).  Russell has a strike rate of 196.15 against pace this IPL but has got out to pace nine times. In comparison, he has faced only 31 deliveries of spin without getting dismissed but strikes at only 145.16 against them.  What they said:  ""We haven't looked at other teams.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour. Just one spot is likely to be debated in the team meeting but it's highly likely they will go in with an unchanged XI.

Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).

IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).  In the five matches in May, Buttler has scored 48.38% of the total runs RR have made in the five games (389/804).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour.

Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now.

But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.

Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done.

The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).  In the five matches in May, Buttler has scored 48.38% of the total runs RR have made in the five games (389/804).  Russell has a strike rate of 196.15 against pace this IPL but has got out to pace nine times.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour. Just one spot is likely to be debated in the team meeting but it's highly likely they will go in with an unchanged XI.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).  In the five matches in May, Buttler has scored 48.38% of the total runs RR have made in the five games (389/804).  Russell has a strike rate of 196.15 against pace this IPL but has got out to pace nine times. In comparison, he has faced only 31 deliveries of spin without getting dismissed but strikes at only 145.16 against them.  What they said:  ""We haven't looked at other teams.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour.

While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour.

Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour. Just one spot is likely to be debated in the team meeting but it's highly likely they will go in with an unchanged XI.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).  In the five matches in May, Buttler has scored 48.38% of the total runs RR have made in the five games (389/804).  Russell has a strike rate of 196.15 against pace this IPL but has got out to pace nine times. In comparison, he has faced only 31 deliveries of spin without getting dismissed but strikes at only 145.16 against them.  What they said:  ""We haven't looked at other teams.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).  In the five matches in May, Buttler has scored 48.38% of the total runs RR have made in the five games (389/804).  Russell has a strike rate of 196.15 against pace this IPL but has got out to pace nine times. In comparison, he has faced only 31 deliveries of spin without getting dismissed but strikes at only 145.16 against them.  What they said:  ""We haven't looked at other teams. We have the destiny in our hands and if we play two good games then we go into the playoffs. We have to take it one game at a time.

As far as rest of the teams are concerned, we are not really worried about what they are doing"" - Jacques Kallis."," Preview by Akash Sarkar   Rajasthan Royals land in Kolkata on the back of three consecutive, dominating and extremely impressive wins. Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour. Just one spot is likely to be debated in the team meeting but it's highly likely they will go in with an unchanged XI.

While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

As far as rest of the teams are concerned, we are not really worried about what they are doing"" - Jacques Kallis."," Preview by Akash Sarkar   Rajasthan Royals land in Kolkata on the back of three consecutive, dominating and extremely impressive wins. Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).  In the five matches in May, Buttler has scored 48.38% of the total runs RR have made in the five games (389/804).  Russell has a strike rate of 196.15 against pace this IPL but has got out to pace nine times. In comparison, he has faced only 31 deliveries of spin without getting dismissed but strikes at only 145.16 against them.  What they said:  ""We haven't looked at other teams.

IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).  In the five matches in May, Buttler has scored 48.38% of the total runs RR have made in the five games (389/804).

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.

Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done.

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game.

Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now.

Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.  Both teams held an optional practice session on the eve of the game but most from KKR's first XI turned up to show they mean business. KKR play their last game in Hyderabad against ominous looking SRH. RR head back home to play against fearless RCB. Both teams are desperate to not leave it for too late. That being said, one team, will certainly leave Kolkata hurting a lot more.  When: Tuesday, May 15, 2018  Where: Eden Gardens, Kolkata  What to expect: There has been plenty of rain in the city leading up to the game but things remained clear on the eve of the clash. There's rain forecast on match day as well.  Team news  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi continues to struggle with the finger injury he picked up in the game against CSK. Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.  Probable XI: Sunil Narine, Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa, Nitish Rana, Dinesh Karthik (c & wk), Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Javon Searles, two of Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi and Piyush Chawla, Prasidh Krishna.  Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour.

Interesting face-offs  Narine vs Rahane: Narine has dismissed Rahane thrice in 44 balls conceding 59 runs. Other RR batsmen have generally struggled against Narine with Buttler scoring 26 off 24 (one dismissal), Stokes 13 off 13 (one dismissal) and Samson 21 off 26 (two dismissals).  IPL 2018 trends  KKR and RR have been two of the weakest bowling sides this IPL - KKR in terms of ER (9.41) and RR in terms of wickets captured (60).

Though he bowled in the nets, Jacques Kallis, the coach, confirmed they are going to make a last minute call on his availability. If he does get fit, KKR will have to deal with another headache given Prasidh Krishna's impressive performance with the ball in Indore where batsmen dominated the game. With pace and bounce in the pitch, KKR might just move away from their strategy of playing three spinners - meaning one of Kuldeep Yadav or Piyush Chawla might have to sit out.

Rajasthan Royals: The bounce in the pitch is something D'Arcy Short is certainly going to enjoy and the conditions could just work in his favour.

Their run has meant they've surged to the fifth spot just behind Kolkata Knight Riders, their opponents on Tuesday (May 14), and look good for a late surge into the Top 4.  Both KKR and RR will walk into the contest with similar objectives. The luxury to drop points is now gone and a slip could well prove fatal at the stage this tournament is right now. Both teams, despite their resounding win in the previous encounter, have plenty of issues and are far from polished products heading into the business end of IPL 2018.  RR have done well to give the teams in the top half a major scare. While Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings have qualified for the playoffs, Ajinkya Rahane and his batch of 2018 have left KKR, Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab sweating. But all three wins have come on the back of Jos Buttler. The opener has bailed the team out and managed to push it over the line single-handedly with very little contributions from the other batsmen.  Misfiring Ben Stokes and the fact that Sanju Samson has lost a bit of form should worry the think-tank. The fact that Rahane too hasn't played an innings of substance in the last five games shows there's a major weakness - one that KKR will look to target. Jos Buttler threat looms large and the first thing KKR will aim to do is get rid of him. If they can't, the focus will shift to minimising the damage and squeezing other batsmen. KKR can take heart from Buttler's good run as well.  KKR have lacked the consistency but have done well to bounce back from desperate situations. After the thrashing by MI, they did well to cruise past KXIP in Indore. With a win behind them, it's crucial that they find a way to sustain the momentum. That, however, is easier said than done. RR, with the kind of form they are in, are more than capable of hurting KKR's bouncebackability.
