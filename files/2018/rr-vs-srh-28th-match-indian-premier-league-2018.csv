18.5," Unadkat to Manish Pandey, out Caught by Rahane!! SRH are coming apart here in the death overs. Must say that the RR bowlers have been smart as well in reading the surface and executing the plans. Unadkat does what he does best, a slower ball on a good length that Pandey wants to biff by making room. He has no other choice at this stage, does he? However, doesn't connect it well at all and slices it high towards backward point where the RR skipper does the rest.

17.6," Jofra Archer to Y Pathan, out Caught by D Kulkarni!! Double strike from Archer! He turned it on at the death against the Mumbai Indians and is at it here as well. What a boost RR have got with his inclusion! Terrific death bowler and this over has been further proof of it. Pacy short ball and although it was a tad wide, Pathan was in no position to play it.
