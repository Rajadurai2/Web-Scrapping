So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games.

While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

Head to Head: MI have enjoyed an incredible run against KKR, winning 17, while the hosts have managed just five wins. At the Eden Gardens, MI have a better record with six wins over the home team in eight games.  Team news:  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi picked up a finger injury in the clash against CSK and was forced to sit out of the game in Mumbai.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game.

While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games.

While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games.

Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game.

Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since.

Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games.

While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back.

Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games.

While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.

And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games.

While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games.

While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

18.1," Krunal Pandya to Kuldeep Yadav, out Lbw!! Kuldeep reviews a leg-before call, inadvertently extending KKR's misery by a couple of minutes. Went for a reverse-sweep and missed it by quite a bit. The ball pitched around middle and leg, straightened and would have knocked the stumps over comfortably. KKR go down to their eighth consecutive loss against MI.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back.

Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

Team news:  Kolkata Knight Riders: Shivam Mavi picked up a finger injury in the clash against CSK and was forced to sit out of the game in Mumbai.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games.

While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.

Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die.

Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.

So far, only Sunrisers Hyderabad can claim to have built such momentum that could lead them to a title win after having won five matches in a row, deservedly finding themselves at the top of the table.  Chennai Super Kings had claimed three teams in consecutive matches earlier in the season as did Kings XI Punjab, but both teams have had mixed run since. Kolkata Knight Riders, however, who for now sit on fourth spot, have failed to string more than two wins in a row. With the loss against Mumbai Indians in Mumbai, KKR now need at least three wins from their four games to separate themselves from the chasing pack in the lower half of the table.  Two of their last four games are against the teams occupying the top 3 slots, and it will be crucial that KKR don't leave their qualification hopes hanging until the last game. And hence, the clash against MI becomes crucial. MI have momentum on their side with wins against KXIP and KKR in their last two games. While Rohit Sharma's captaincy was exceptional in the match in Indore - where he negated R Ashwin's ploy to keep Krunal Pandya out of the game with a left-right combination by ekeing out overs from Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Ben Cutting at crucial junctures - the bowlers stood up to squeeze KKR in front of their fans at home.  While it seems like things are finally falling into place for MI after a slow start, KKR are being haunted by the same old problems. They are yet to find a solution to their powerplay woes with the ball. Robin Uthappa has looked in exceptional touch, but no innings of substance just yet has been frustrating. While he did convert his start against MI to score a half-century, he was dismissed at a crucial stage which turned the tide.  Having said that, KKR have exceptionally improved their death bowling to pull games back. Against CSK, they gave away just 87 in the last ten overs, while giving away 86 against MI in the same period.  Chris Lynn, in his pre-match press conference, spoke about how desperate the team is to get momentum back and don't want to end up in a situation where every game is do or die. It could just be that desperation that might do the trick for KKR against a team that has always had the better of them.
