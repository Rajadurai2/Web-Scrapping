 19.6 ,"Rajpoot to Nabi, out Caught by Mayank Agarwal!! Lofted up, not much timing, and a good catch running in from Agarwal. He covered decent ground at long-off before diving forward with both hands. Five-fer for Ankit Rajpoot. Nabi c Mayank Agarwal b Rajpoot 4(2) [4s-1]",SRH Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

However, their stock of pacers have shown that they can just as well make the most of the opportunities in his absence as seen in the last game against MI. However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.

If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.

 18.3 ," Andrew Tye to Manish Pandey, 1 run, pitched right up at the pads, whipped to deep mid-wicket ",SRH Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season.

IPL 2018 trends  KXIP is the best batting team in the Powerplay with a scoring rate of 10.31 while SRH is the only side to concede at less than seven an over with the field up (6.92).

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season.

Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short.

However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind.

 15.4 ," Mujeeb to Y Pathan, no run, again, flat and quick from Mujeeb, pushed Pathan back in the crease and because he's not picking him, he's already forced to defend ",SRH Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.  When: Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Kings XI Punjab, April 26, 20:00 IST  Where: Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad  What to expect: A hot day with temperatures rising to 39 degrees in the day, with Hyderabad coming into its own with the summer.  Team News:  Sunrisers Hyderabad  Bhuvneshwar Kumar's fitness is a concern for Hyderabad. However, their stock of pacers have shown that they can just as well make the most of the opportunities in his absence as seen in the last game against MI. However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.

Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).

Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.

 13.4 ," Mujeeb to Shakib, out Caught by Mayank Agarwal!! This was coming! Shakib was struggling to get the young Afghan away, goes for the big mow over mid-wicket and holes out to long-on. He didn't pick this wrong 'un, came down the track, didn't get anywhere close to the ball, was eyeing the mid-wicket fence, got a fat leading edge on the lofted drive, high and towards long-on. Mayank settled under it and holds on. Shakib c Mayank Agarwal b Mujeeb 28(29) [4s-3] ",SRH Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Team News:  Sunrisers Hyderabad  Bhuvneshwar Kumar's fitness is a concern for Hyderabad. However, their stock of pacers have shown that they can just as well make the most of the opportunities in his absence as seen in the last game against MI. However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.

Only Ashwin has dismissed Gayle as often in IPL.  Gayle vs Bhuvneshwar: Gayle has scored 119 runs from just 82 balls of Bhuvneshwar getting out only once.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season.

 10.5 ," Andrew Tye to Manish Pandey, no run, back of a length and just outside off, ideal pace for Manish and he only manages to find the fielder at short third man ",SRH Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season.

 8.4 ," Ashwin to Manish Pandey, 2 runs, the carrom ball from Ashwin, driven towards cover where Mujeeb makes a mess of a simple stop, concedes two runs in the process ",SRH Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

When: Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Kings XI Punjab, April 26, 20:00 IST  Where: Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad  What to expect: A hot day with temperatures rising to 39 degrees in the day, with Hyderabad coming into its own with the summer.  Team News:  Sunrisers Hyderabad  Bhuvneshwar Kumar's fitness is a concern for Hyderabad. However, their stock of pacers have shown that they can just as well make the most of the opportunities in his absence as seen in the last game against MI. However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.

Head to Head of teams  SRH 8 - 3 KXIP  Team Record at that particular venue  SRH 4 - 1 KXIP  Interesting face-offs  Gayle vs Sandeep Sharma: Sandeep Sharma has dismissed Gayle four times in 49 balls conceding 55 runs. Only Ashwin has dismissed Gayle as often in IPL.  Gayle vs Bhuvneshwar: Gayle has scored 119 runs from just 82 balls of Bhuvneshwar getting out only once. He has hit eight sixes off these 82 balls from Bhuvneshwar.  Manish Pandey vs Axar: Pandey has scored only 23 runs off the 39 balls from Axar getting out twice hitting just a solitary boundary.  Venue trends  KXIP's only win at this venue came in 2014 when they chased down 206 against SRH.  Since 2015, no team has successfully chased down a 150+ target in IPL matches in Hyderabad.  IPL 2018 trends  KXIP is the best batting team in the Powerplay with a scoring rate of 10.31 while SRH is the only side to concede at less than seven an over with the field up (6.92).

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.

 3.6 ," Barinder to Manish Pandey, 2 runs, chance and Ashwin puts in a laborious dive, don't think he even got his fingers onto the ball. A badly mistimed shovel from Manish as he looked to go back over the bowler's head, went very high and over mid-off. Ashwin ran back, kept his eyes on the ball, stretched out as it lobbed over his shoulders and can't quite complete the catch ",SRH Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game.

Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.

Head to Head of teams  SRH 8 - 3 KXIP  Team Record at that particular venue  SRH 4 - 1 KXIP  Interesting face-offs  Gayle vs Sandeep Sharma: Sandeep Sharma has dismissed Gayle four times in 49 balls conceding 55 runs. Only Ashwin has dismissed Gayle as often in IPL.  Gayle vs Bhuvneshwar: Gayle has scored 119 runs from just 82 balls of Bhuvneshwar getting out only once. He has hit eight sixes off these 82 balls from Bhuvneshwar.  Manish Pandey vs Axar: Pandey has scored only 23 runs off the 39 balls from Axar getting out twice hitting just a solitary boundary.  Venue trends  KXIP's only win at this venue came in 2014 when they chased down 206 against SRH.  Since 2015, no team has successfully chased down a 150+ target in IPL matches in Hyderabad.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.

Head to Head of teams  SRH 8 - 3 KXIP  Team Record at that particular venue  SRH 4 - 1 KXIP  Interesting face-offs  Gayle vs Sandeep Sharma: Sandeep Sharma has dismissed Gayle four times in 49 balls conceding 55 runs. Only Ashwin has dismissed Gayle as often in IPL.  Gayle vs Bhuvneshwar: Gayle has scored 119 runs from just 82 balls of Bhuvneshwar getting out only once.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

 17.4 ," Rashid Khan to Rajpoot, 1 run, another hoick, loops up in the air and falls short of backward square ",PBKS Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Team News:  Sunrisers Hyderabad  Bhuvneshwar Kumar's fitness is a concern for Hyderabad. However, their stock of pacers have shown that they can just as well make the most of the opportunities in his absence as seen in the last game against MI. However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.

It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season.

Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short.

Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.

 15.3 ," Sandeep Sharma to Manoj Tiwary, out Caught by Williamson!! Give Williamson 10 bowlers and he'll win matches. Gee, how good is this SRH bowling? KXIP 6 down. Sheer panic. Manoj Tiwary got across to this off-cutter and couldn't control his flick shot on the move, foxed by the lack of pace I reckon. It smacks the toe-end and loops up to KW at mid-wicket who gobbles up with supreme ease. Manoj Tiwary c Williamson b Sandeep Sharma 1(5) ",PBKS Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season.

Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

However, their stock of pacers have shown that they can just as well make the most of the opportunities in his absence as seen in the last game against MI. However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.

Only Ashwin has dismissed Gayle as often in IPL.  Gayle vs Bhuvneshwar: Gayle has scored 119 runs from just 82 balls of Bhuvneshwar getting out only once.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.

Only Ashwin has dismissed Gayle as often in IPL.  Gayle vs Bhuvneshwar: Gayle has scored 119 runs from just 82 balls of Bhuvneshwar getting out only once.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.  When: Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Kings XI Punjab, April 26, 20:00 IST  Where: Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad  What to expect: A hot day with temperatures rising to 39 degrees in the day, with Hyderabad coming into its own with the summer.  Team News:  Sunrisers Hyderabad  Bhuvneshwar Kumar's fitness is a concern for Hyderabad. However, their stock of pacers have shown that they can just as well make the most of the opportunities in his absence as seen in the last game against MI. However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.

Only Ashwin has dismissed Gayle as often in IPL.  Gayle vs Bhuvneshwar: Gayle has scored 119 runs from just 82 balls of Bhuvneshwar getting out only once.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind.

Head to Head of teams  SRH 8 - 3 KXIP  Team Record at that particular venue  SRH 4 - 1 KXIP  Interesting face-offs  Gayle vs Sandeep Sharma: Sandeep Sharma has dismissed Gayle four times in 49 balls conceding 55 runs. Only Ashwin has dismissed Gayle as often in IPL.  Gayle vs Bhuvneshwar: Gayle has scored 119 runs from just 82 balls of Bhuvneshwar getting out only once.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

 9.5 ," Shakib to Mayank Agarwal, 1 run, camps back in his crease and works this quicker delivery through mid-wicket ",PBKS Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Team News:  Sunrisers Hyderabad  Bhuvneshwar Kumar's fitness is a concern for Hyderabad. However, their stock of pacers have shown that they can just as well make the most of the opportunities in his absence as seen in the last game against MI. However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.

The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

 8.2 ," Basil Thampi to Gayle, out Caught&Bowled!! Guess what, the young man from Kerala has beaten Chris Gayle for pace. The advantage of that busting action and jump. Gets the short ball to climb awkwardly onto Gayle who miscues the ambitious pull round the corner, just a few yards to the left of nonexistent square leg. Basil Thampi says mine, runs around and controls his momentum to take a clean catch. Boy, is he pumped or what... Gayle c and b Basil Thampi 23(22) [4s-1 6s-2] ",PBKS Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.

 7.4 ," Rashid Khan to Gayle, 1 run, goes hard once again, drags it off the inside edge behind square on the leg-side ",PBKS Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Team News:  Sunrisers Hyderabad  Bhuvneshwar Kumar's fitness is a concern for Hyderabad. However, their stock of pacers have shown that they can just as well make the most of the opportunities in his absence as seen in the last game against MI. However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.

However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.  Probable XIs:  SRH - Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson (c), Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi/Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Sandeep Sharma, Siddarth Kaul  KXIP - Lokesh Rahul (wk), Chris Gayle, Karun Nair, Mayank Agarwal, Aaron Finch, Yuvraj Singh, Ravichandran Ashwin (c), Andrew Tye, Ankit Rajpoot, Barinder Sran, Mujeeb Ur Rahman  What they said:  ""Just like we have been performing in our previous games, we will continue to do so in tomorrow's game as well.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

 3.2 ," Nabi to Gayle, 1 run, darts it on a back of length, sliding into middle and leg, softly knocked into the mid-wicket region ",PBKS Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.

Only Ashwin has dismissed Gayle as often in IPL.  Gayle vs Bhuvneshwar: Gayle has scored 119 runs from just 82 balls of Bhuvneshwar getting out only once.

IPL 2018 trends  KXIP is the best batting team in the Powerplay with a scoring rate of 10.31 while SRH is the only side to concede at less than seven an over with the field up (6.92).

Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season.

 0.3 ," Sandeep Sharma to Rahul, 1 run, ducking in on middle and leg, back of length, clipped away neatly to deep square leg ",PBKS Inns,25t,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Punjab Kings,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Kane Williamson(c), Wriddhiman Saha(w), Manish Pandey, Shakib Al Hasan, Yusuf Pathan, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Basil Thampi, Siddarth Kaul, Sandeep Sharma",,"Preview by Kritika Naidu  On a supposed 190-wicket at the Wankhede on Tuesday, the Sunrisers Hyderabad mustered a meek 118 against Mumbai Indians. Evidently, Kane Williamson and Co have frailties in the batting department that need refurbishing.  It must be noted though, that despite putting up the lowest score in a full 20-over innings in this edition of the Indian Premier League, Hyderabad pulled off a 31-run victory. And that the defence of the lowly score came in the absence of their premier paceman - Bhuvneshwar Kumar.  Adversity, it seems, brings out the best in Hyderabad and that trait will be put to the test when they take on Kings XI Punjab at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Uppal on Thursday (April 26).  Hyderabad's stomach for a stiff fight is an obvious outcome of their immaculate auction strategy. Tom Moody, the head coach, did mention in the aftermath that they had gone into the auction with the idea of like-for-like replacements for each player. In Bhuvneshwar's case, it has been Siddarth Kaul. The paceman has assumed immense responsibility, and with Rashid Khan, the duo ensured Mumbai were beaten in their own backyard after picking up five wickets between them while conceding just 34 runs. The pair of Sandeep Sharma and Basil Thampi, who made his SRH debut, was outstanding, giving away little for their three wickets, showcasing the depth in SRH's bowling stocks even in the absence of their spearhead.  It was the same Rashid, who returned with 2-11 with a maiden on the night, who was clobbered for 55 runs in his four overs against Kings XI Punjab earlier in the season - the most he has ever conceded in a T20. Chris Gayle smashed him for as many as six sixes as Rashid erred in his lengths, bowling too full. The Jamaican went on to score a century - 42 runs of which came off Rashid's 16 balls, and SRH, who were undefeated in the tournament at that stage with three wins on the trot, were handed their first defeat.  That loss against Punjab saw them slip down the table to third, while R Ashwin's men have subsequently grown in stature and shifted themselves to the helm.  Punjab have won four games in succession and have five wins out of six games, but they aren't looking impenetrable. They have only managed to hold their nerve under trying circumstances, which, it must be said, isn't the easiest thing to do.  Barring the minor hiccup against Royal Challengers Bangalore, they have been clinical all through under the shrewd leadership of R Ashwin. KL Rahul and Gayle have given them such strong starts that it has eased roles for the middle-order bats. Those sparkling starts have even masked the failures of Aaron Finch and Yuvraj Singh, who have had lean seasons so far. When Gayle was rested in the previous game against Delhi Daredevils due to soreness, Punjab's batting didn't stand out, and that's something Hyderabad will have on their mind. Get the openers out and open up Punjab's soft underbelly of a middle order.  While the batting is their strong suit, the bowling hasn't, barring in the game against Delhi, done exceedingly well, conceding a few big scores.  In a sense, Punjab are quite balanced in their dependency on batting and bowling. Hyderabad certainly aren't. Their bowling has won them pretty much every game so far and they'll need to do something to shake up that trend. Shikhar Dhawan returned from injury after missing the clash against Chennai Super Kings, but didn't provide the ideal start against Mumbai and immediately much of the pressure fell on Kane Williamson, who opened the batting for the first time this season. The SRH captain has looked in divine touch, but he cannot possibly lug the weight of the responsibility on his slender shoulders for too long.  Punjab were smart in Mohali to exploit SRH's batting weakness by having them chase. SRH came close but expectedly fell short. If SRH are to avoid a defeat in the return fixture, they need to address their concerns with the bat and expect their strike bowlers to come good.  The good thing though, is that Rashid has, admittedly, learnt a lesson after the Gayle marauding, and he's better for it. That perhaps should be a lesson for the team as well.

Team News:  Sunrisers Hyderabad  Bhuvneshwar Kumar's fitness is a concern for Hyderabad. However, their stock of pacers have shown that they can just as well make the most of the opportunities in his absence as seen in the last game against MI. However, if they opt to beef up their batting, they could go in with Carlos Brathwaite for Mohammad Nabi.  Kings XI Punjab  Punjab had an optional training session on the eve of the game. While most of them turned up, the notable absentees were Gayle, Ashwin and KL Rahul. Gayle, however, is likely to return after having missed out on the last clash due to a stiff back.
