Abhinav came sprinting in from sweeper to his right and collected the ball cleanly before sending a rifle-like throw at the batting end. The call was always for two and Zampa was casually trundling to the batting end probably assuming the only he was could get out was a direct hit. And bam! The ball bounced off the outfield and kept low before striking the stumps dead.
