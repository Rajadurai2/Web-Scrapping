Batter a long way down the pitch, was impact too far away, was it too high? But Siraj believed. He roared and pleaded for the finger to go up. You can totally understand the ump saying no onfield. Virat turned to Siraj. The bowler demanded, DK ran to Virat with 8 odd seconds left. Virat had a quick glance at the timer as it was ticking while DK was giving his inputs and with 1 second on the timer Virat says yes, case referred. Ball-tracker said impact in line, impact not too far away from the stumps and hitting top of middle and leg. Siraj roars, the roar of victory and achievement. RCB are winning the PP quite easily.
