Line wise that's surely in line. Could be too far down. No bat as well as UltraEdge stays silent. Wowww. Hitting. This is one of the best reviews in cricket recently. All odds against the call. Batter a long way down the pitch, was impact too far away, was it too high? But Siraj believed. He roared and pleaded for the finger to go up. You can totally understand the ump saying no onfield. Virat turned to Siraj. The bowler demanded, DK ran to Virat with 8 odd seconds left. Virat had a quick glance at the timer as it was ticking while DK was giving his inputs and with 1 second on the timer Virat says yes, case referred. Ball-tracker said impact in line, impact not too far away from the stumps and hitting top of middle and leg. Siraj roars, the roar of victory and achievement. RCB are winning the PP quite easily.

0.2,"Siraj to Atharva Taide, out Lbw!! What a gun bowler Siraj has turned into. Tests, then bossed the ODIs, now is making a strong case in the T20 format too. Wrap him in cotton please. The obvious inswinger to the left-hander from Siraj, did it pitch in line was the question. The ump said no despite a really strong appeal. RCB discussed and signalled the T. Replays confirmed no edge. Pitching in line, hitting in line and smashing leg stump to let RCB into a roar. The head fell too far across for Atharva and he was found out.
