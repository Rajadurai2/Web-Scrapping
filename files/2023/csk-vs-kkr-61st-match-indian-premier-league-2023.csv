0.6,"Chahar to Gurbaz, out Caught by Tushar Deshpande!! Gurbaz, Gurbaz! That was a hit me ball and he's hit it to hand. He stands there in disbelief. He doesn't want to go. You can understand that disappointment. Full and wide outside off stump, proper dangling the carrot there from Chahar, Gurbaz slices it completely as he looks to drive. Tushar had distance to cover to the right, but he had his eyes on the ball and judged it to perfection. Also ensured he didn't trip onto the boundary rope. Great catch that.
