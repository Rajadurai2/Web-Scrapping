4.5," Narine to Nair, out Lbw!! Narine has got past the dangerous opening partnership. Karun was looking solid, but gets too ambitious and pays the ultimate penalty.

Need to have a look at the replays, but it was certainly hitting the stumps, the umpire doesn't think a lot, up goes the dreaded finger. Replays prove he was just about right, both impact and hitting the stumps remained with the umpire's call.
