17.1," Milne to Stokes, out Bowled!! The stumps just keep flying. The heart of Pune being ripped apart here. And so is this innings. A length delivery assumed to be in the slot for the slog here from Stokes. He lines up neatly and does everything right in swinging his ba putting all forearms to good use. Just that there is hardly any bounce here to sit up for the timing to come out right. Scoots under the flat bat and sends the off-pole on a cartwheel.

16.5," Aravind to Christian, out Caught by Mandeep!! They are falling apart. Three wickets in the span of six balls. All the momentum that seemed to have drifted Pune's way has surely been redirected via the national highway to Bangalore. A fullish delivery this and full-paced as well for a change.
