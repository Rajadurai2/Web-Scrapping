First it was RCB - now it's the DD. Slower ball from Mohit, Nadeem didn't read it at all, popped his bat forward, closed the face on the tuck, got a leading edge and it's an absolute dolly to the bowler.

Shami had the right idea, he was looking to crack it over point, but the execution went all awry.
