17.1,"Mohit Sharma to Nadeem, out Caught&Bowled!! DD have been bundled out for their lowest score in IPL - the 10th edition is bringing in some unwanted records for teams. First it was RCB - now it's the DD. Slower ball from Mohit, Nadeem didn't read it at all, popped his bat forward, closed the face on the tuck, got a leading edge and it's an absolute dolly to the bowler. Not sure if the Mohali crowd enjoyed the show from DD - you don't want to watch a mismatch after having paid big money for the tickets.

Can't blame Shami though, DD needed some quick runs, but there's nothing coming today. This was short and wide of off, asking to be smacked. Shami had the right idea, he was looking to crack it over point, but the execution went all awry.
