Team news:  Delhi Capitals  There's a genuine case for swapping the batting positions of Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer, who currently bat at No 4 and 3 respectively. There have been three collapses in three games, and each has been triggered by Pant's wicket, with Iyer falling before him everytime. The option to have the team's captain come after Pant's done his bit with the bat isn't a bad idea.

Delhi's bouncebackability from a rut of similar collapses, when they have thawed at the sight of easy targets closing on, will be the main center of interest in their game against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, a team so well covered and in such good form that Kane Williamson's absence against RCB probably didn't even matter.  What piques interest though is the pitch SRH will be playing on. The track at Feroz Shah Kotla will be like anything but Hyderabad, which has come a long way from being the forcing house for two legspinners and delivered consecutive 200-plus totals this season. Kotla, in contrast, will be low and slow with variable bounce, giving batsmen little to hit through the line.

Team news:  Delhi Capitals  There's a genuine case for swapping the batting positions of Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer, who currently bat at No 4 and 3 respectively. There have been three collapses in three games, and each has been triggered by Pant's wicket, with Iyer falling before him everytime. The option to have the team's captain come after Pant's done his bit with the bat isn't a bad idea.

When: Delhi Capitals vs Sunrisers Hyderabad, 16th Match at 8:00 PM IST  Where: Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi  What to expect: 24 hours before the game, the pitch bore the usual barren look though previous IPL games have seen pitches with more grass. Whether it's a tactic to drive SRH out of their comfort zone is anyone's guess.  It's going to be a warm evening, with temperatures set to be around 34 degrees at the start of the match. The expected dew should make batting easier in the second innings.  Team news:  Delhi Capitals  There's a genuine case for swapping the batting positions of Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer, who currently bat at No 4 and 3 respectively. There have been three collapses in three games, and each has been triggered by Pant's wicket, with Iyer falling before him everytime. The option to have the team's captain come after Pant's done his bit with the bat isn't a bad idea.  Amit Mishra could come back in for Avesh Khan, to whom he had lost his spot on a flatter Mohali pitch. Axar Patel might replace Harshal Patel to give that middle-order a lift.  Probable XI: Prithvi Shaw, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant(w), Shreyas Iyer(c), Colin Ingram, Hanuma Vihari, Chris Morris, Harshal Patel/Axar Patel, Sandeep Lamichhane, Kagiso Rabada/Trent Boult, Amit Mishra/Avesh Khan  Sunrisers Hyderabad  David Warner was bruised on his finger while taking Virat Kohli's catch in the last game and was off the field, but Tom Moody has confirmed that Warner is fit to play.
