 19.6 ,"Dwayne Bravo to Hardik Pandya, SIX, 29 off the last over! And Mumbai ends the innings in a sensational fashion. It was a fuller length delivery wide of off, Hardik Pandya uses his wrists brilliantly again to lift it over deep backward point for another maximum",MI Inns,15t,Mumbai Indians,Chennai Super Kings,"Mumbai Indians (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma(c), Quinton de Kock(w), Suryakumar Yadav, Yuvraj Singh, Kieron Pollard, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Rahul Chahar, Jasprit Bumrah, Lasith Malinga, Jason Behrendorff","Chennai Super Kings (Playing XI): Ambati Rayudu, Shane Watson, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Kedar Jadhav, Dwayne Bravo, Ravindra Jadeja, Deepak Chahar, Mohit Sharma, Shardul Thakur, Imran Tahir","Preview by Kaushik Rangarajan  Landscape gazing from an aeroplane window in India can make for an interesting exercise, because the topography of each city has a story of its own to tell. Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season. Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season. More so when two points against an early-season Mumbai could be there for the taking - two points that'll put them one step closer to maintaining their proud playoffs record.

In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season. Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

Team News:  Mumbai Indians  There are grounds to bring in both Ishan Kishan and Ben Cutting into the line-up, although this youth over experience logic is just what their opponents furrow their brows at. Mitchell McClenaghan, a reliable operator for the franchise in the past, hasn't had the best of starts so far and could make way for Australian quick Jason Behrendorff, who has joined the squad after his national team commitments.

Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season. Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season. Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games.

It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season.

It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest.

Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season. More so when two points against an early-season Mumbai could be there for the taking - two points that'll put them one step closer to maintaining their proud playoffs record.

Team News:  Mumbai Indians  There are grounds to bring in both Ishan Kishan and Ben Cutting into the line-up, although this youth over experience logic is just what their opponents furrow their brows at.

 7.1 ,"Jadeja to Rohit, out Caught by Dhoni!! What a start for Jadeja. Gets a faint edge and Dhoni manages to cling on. Flighted delivery pitching on the off stump and spinning away sharply, Rohit tried defending but the feet were stuck in the crease. Dhoni made no mistake and also checked the bails off to be doubly sure about the dismissal as Ro was close with his back foot in the crease. Tough catch because the ball almost shaved the off stump as well. Oh they are checking for the no-ball, Raina blocks the side angle from deep cover, but the other angle shows a very minute portion of the heel to be behind the crease when Jadeja landed. Third umpire is convinced and it will be OUT. A sluggish start from Rohit, he needs to be a lot more positive as an opener.

Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season. Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.

Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season. Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself.

In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest.

 17.5 ," Malinga to Dwayne Bravo, out Caught by de Kock!! Stunner from QDK! Brilliance from the South African and that's the end of a forgettable night for Bravo. Made room for the big shot but this was in the blockhole, cramped him as well and he got a faint inside edge.

Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season. Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season. More so when two points against an early-season Mumbai could be there for the taking - two points that'll put them one step closer to maintaining their proud playoffs record.

It's not a kind of game the Super Kings have played so far this season and thus will be eager to test their batting prowess. On such a pitch, spinners could be momentarily forced to contemplate their choice of a vocation, and the team batting first will constantly recalibrate a par score to account for the dew allowance.  Team News:  Mumbai Indians  There are grounds to bring in both Ishan Kishan and Ben Cutting into the line-up, although this youth over experience logic is just what their opponents furrow their brows at.

Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

Mitchell McClenaghan, a reliable operator for the franchise in the past, hasn't had the best of starts so far and could make way for Australian quick Jason Behrendorff, who has joined the squad after his national team commitments.

Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season. Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself.

But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest.

It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season. More so when two points against an early-season Mumbai could be there for the taking - two points that'll put them one step closer to maintaining their proud playoffs record.

A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season. Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

On such a pitch, spinners could be momentarily forced to contemplate their choice of a vocation, and the team batting first will constantly recalibrate a par score to account for the dew allowance.  Team News:  Mumbai Indians  There are grounds to bring in both Ishan Kishan and Ben Cutting into the line-up, although this youth over experience logic is just what their opponents furrow their brows at. Mitchell McClenaghan, a reliable operator for the franchise in the past, hasn't had the best of starts so far and could make way for Australian quick Jason Behrendorff, who has joined the squad after his national team commitments.  Probable XI: Rohit Sharma (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Yuvraj Singh/Ishan Kishan, Kieron Pollard/Ben Cutting, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Mayank Markande, Jason Behrendorff/Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah, Lasith Malinga  Chennai Super Kings  A game for Faf du Plessis, who batted the longest on the eve of the game, is a possibility and could move Rayudu to the comforts of the middle order in a role he had much success as a Mumbai Indians player. Alternatively, CSK might also revert to fielding only three foriegn players if they desire an extra seamer and death bowling option in Mohit Sharma if they don't see value in playing Mitchell Santner in another dewy game.  B6$ Shane Watson, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni (c&wk), Dwayne Bravo, Ravindra Jadeja, Mitchell Santner/Mohit Sharma, Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur, Imran Tahir  Did you know?  - A victory for Mumbai Indians will make them the first side to win 100 matches (including SuperOvers)  - CSK have a 3-5 record against Mumbai Indians in IPL matches at the Wankhede Stadium  - There is no discernible advantage of chasing here with teams batting first winning exactly 5 of the last 10 games.

Mumbai Indians will have left Mohali wondering why they don't replicate the consistency of Chandigarh's well-structured, symmetric panorama in their own performances at the start of an IPL season. Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season. More so when two points against an early-season Mumbai could be there for the taking - two points that'll put them one step closer to maintaining their proud playoffs record.

Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season. More so when two points against an early-season Mumbai could be there for the taking - two points that'll put them one step closer to maintaining their proud playoffs record.

It's not a kind of game the Super Kings have played so far this season and thus will be eager to test their batting prowess. On such a pitch, spinners could be momentarily forced to contemplate their choice of a vocation, and the team batting first will constantly recalibrate a par score to account for the dew allowance.  Team News:  Mumbai Indians  There are grounds to bring in both Ishan Kishan and Ben Cutting into the line-up, although this youth over experience logic is just what their opponents furrow their brows at. Mitchell McClenaghan, a reliable operator for the franchise in the past, hasn't had the best of starts so far and could make way for Australian quick Jason Behrendorff, who has joined the squad after his national team commitments.

It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death.

Three games in, they have chosen once again to mirror the chaotic visual that is their home city. One aesthetic high-rise packed between two dingy apartments with peeling plasters.  It is too early for panic stations, but a third defeat in four games could nudge Rohit Sharma & Co. just there. The timing of CSK's visit, therefore, is opportune, for nothing fuels the drive for excellence in Mumbai Indians as much as the sight of excellence itself. Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season.

Pounded it short, sprang up like a spitting Cobra after hitting the deck just outside off. Rayudu was just pushing his bat forward aiming to defend.

Michael Hussey, who has donned both yellow and blue in this contest, subscribes to this theory in big games. It perhaps offers some explanation for Mumbai's head-to-head advantage over their fellow three-time champions (13-11), who enjoy a winning record against the rest of the league.  But, for Mumbai to shrug off their indifferent start, it will be imperative for them to nip a developing middle-order problem in the bud. A trio of Suryakumar Yadav, Kieron Pollard and Yuvraj Singh has struggled to sustain the tempo of a fast start through the middle phase of the innings, leaving Hardik Pandya to do much of the heavy-lifting at the death. It is this very middle-overs battle that MS Dhoni succeeded in winning against Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals.  In comparison, CSK only have a couple of minor issues - the form of Ambati Rayudu, and death bowling - to address, but their customary fast start to the season of three wins in three, keeps them relatively pressure-free heading into this contest. It would be unwise to expect them to take a foot off the pedal at Wankhede, where they won three emotionally-charged games and a third IPL crown last season. More so when two points against an early-season Mumbai could be there for the taking - two points that'll put them one step closer to maintaining their proud playoffs record.  When: Mumbai Indians vs Chennai Super Kings, April 3, 20:00 IST  Where: Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: A slug fest on a batting beauty. It's not a kind of game the Super Kings have played so far this season and thus will be eager to test their batting prowess. On such a pitch, spinners could be momentarily forced to contemplate their choice of a vocation, and the team batting first will constantly recalibrate a par score to account for the dew allowance.  Team News:  Mumbai Indians  There are grounds to bring in both Ishan Kishan and Ben Cutting into the line-up, although this youth over experience logic is just what their opponents furrow their brows at. Mitchell McClenaghan, a reliable operator for the franchise in the past, hasn't had the best of starts so far and could make way for Australian quick Jason Behrendorff, who has joined the squad after his national team commitments.  Probable XI: Rohit Sharma (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Yuvraj Singh/Ishan Kishan, Kieron Pollard/Ben Cutting, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Mayank Markande, Jason Behrendorff/Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah, Lasith Malinga  Chennai Super Kings  A game for Faf du Plessis, who batted the longest on the eve of the game, is a possibility and could move Rayudu to the comforts of the middle order in a role he had much success as a Mumbai Indians player. Alternatively, CSK might also revert to fielding only three foriegn players if they desire an extra seamer and death bowling option in Mohit Sharma if they don't see value in playing Mitchell Santner in another dewy game.
