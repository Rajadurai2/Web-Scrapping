1.3," Alzarri Joseph to Buttler, FOUR, lifted over the infield! One of Buttler's go-to shots in the powerplay. Stands tall this time to the good length ball and carves it over cover.

0.6," Behrendorff to Rahane, no run, good review in the end from Rahane! Fell across a bit on the flick and missed the indipper to get pinged on the front pad. The umpire didn't waste any time in raising his finger for the LBW but Rahane wanted to review it. Height was the only thing that could have bailed him out and even that didn't look likely in real time.

0.4," Behrendorff to Rahane, FOUR, dropped by Rohit! Sharp chance but he didn't time the leap well, ended up getting a hand and it dribbled away down to the long-off fence.
