19.1," D Kulkarni to Miller, out Caught by Buttler!! The KXIP innings is falling apart at the final leg, thereby derailing that flourish that they were looking for. The well-set Miller is the latest casualty. Made room for the big shot but Kulkarni followed him with a slower ball on a good length. Couldn't free his arms properly and ended up skewing the loft high into the night skies at deep mid-wicket. Not easy, these high catches but Buttler is a pro in the outfield. Pouches the skier with ease.

18.6," Jofra Archer to Mandeep, out Bowled!! The leg stump has been flattened! Outstanding over from Archer, just three runs and has taken two wickets too. After a series of fiery pacy deliveries, he opts for the slower one, the back-of-the-hand option and Mandeep clearly hasn't picked it at all. Saw the length very short and backed away for the pull but the ball never really arrived. Ends up getting an inside edge that damages the woodwork. Brilliant fightback from the Royals.

18.3," Jofra Archer to Pooran, out Caught by Rahane!! Mistimed and picks out extra cover. Pooran has been done in for pace here, it's a low full toss but quite brisk and hence, isn't able to connect properly. Ends up cue-ending the shot towards the off-side where the RR skipper takes a tumbling catch, diving forward. This is a fine passage of play for the visitors.
