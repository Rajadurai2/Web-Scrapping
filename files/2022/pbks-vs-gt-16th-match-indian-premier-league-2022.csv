19.6," Hardik Pandya to Arshdeep Singh, 3 runs, comedy of errors to finish the innings! Short ball, pulled hard to deep mid-wicket and they decide to risk the second run as it's the final delivery. The throw is wayward at the keeper's end and they then go for the third run that's surely not on. Should have been an easy run out but Hardik dislodged the stumps with his back foot before he could put the ball onto the stumps.
