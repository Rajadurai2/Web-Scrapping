15.1," Narine to Powell, out Caught by (sub)Rinku Singh!! Not the greatest bit of batting from Powell with this being Narine's final over! Goes for a hopeful slog sweep, miscues it completely towards the deep square leg region and Rinku gets across to take the catch, running across from a finer positin. Good catch under pressure and this is a decent phase for KKR with some wickets. Must say it's poor game awareness from Powell. So often these days, we see the powerhitters getting too greedy and paying the price.
