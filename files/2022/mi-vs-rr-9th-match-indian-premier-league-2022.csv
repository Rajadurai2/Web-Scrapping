15.2," Chahal to Daniel Sams, out Caught by Buttler!! Golden duck for Sams! Atrocious shot first up from the all-rounder, especially with just few more deliveries of spin left. Floated up by Chahal, tempts the big shot and Sams falls into the trap. What a catch it is from Buttler though! This mishit was in the air for a lifetime, he trekked back and timed his dive perfectly near the deep mid-wicket region. Took it effortlessly. RR's spin twins are spinning their team to a win here.

15.1," Chahal to Tim David, out Lbw!! Cracking leg break from Chahal and he's dealt a huge blow here! Proper classical spin bowling, lands this around leg stump, sharp leg break that also skids a tad and David is pinned on the crease unable to negotiate the turn. Don't think he expected so much turn either. Struck on the back pad and it looked a fair shout in real time. Given by the ump and David tried to test his luck with DRS. In the end, it was a very marginal call. Just about pitching in line of leg stump and just clipping the top of off stump. RR are starting to gain an advantage here.
