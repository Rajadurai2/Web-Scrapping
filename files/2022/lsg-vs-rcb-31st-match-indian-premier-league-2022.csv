And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first.

Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball.

While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin. His strike rate is 141.17 against slower bowlers, which dips to 75 against wrist spin, with the wicketkeeper batter having managed only 12 off 16. Rajasthan Royals held back an over from Yuzvendra Chahal while Delhi Capitals did the same with Kuldeep Yadav, whose final over was kept until the 20th. LSG could do the same with Ravi Bishnoi.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first.

Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first.

Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball.

While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball.

While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings.

Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin. His strike rate is 141.17 against slower bowlers, which dips to 75 against wrist spin, with the wicketkeeper batter having managed only 12 off 16.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball.

While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team.

RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game.

While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first.

Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first.

Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.

Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball.

While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings.

After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin. His strike rate is 141.17 against slower bowlers, which dips to 75 against wrist spin, with the wicketkeeper batter having managed only 12 off 16.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team.

RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin. His strike rate is 141.17 against slower bowlers, which dips to 75 against wrist spin, with the wicketkeeper batter having managed only 12 off 16.

16.4," Hazlewood to Ayush Badoni, out Caught by Karthik!! Badoni walks straight into the trap! A classic case of strength becoming your weakness. He loves to play that AB-esque sweep against the fast bowlers and square leg was brought up, tempting him to try that shot of his. And he accepts the invitation. But Hazlewood is too clever for the young man, pounding this on a hard length and keeping it wide of the batter's reach. The result is a feather through to Karthik behind the stumps. Badoni premeditated just a bit too much and Hazlewood is too experienced a bowler to fall for that trick.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball.

While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.

RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin.

12.3," Siraj to Hooda, out Caught by Prabhudessai!! What a catch! Sharp diving take from young Prabhudessai who had to run a fair distance forward and this was always dipping on him. Executes the catch perfectly. Oh hang on, they're checking if it's the second bouncer of the over, in which case this will be a no-ball. Nope, the third ump is quite happy that it isn't a bouncer and Hooda has to go. Soft dismissal this, short and wide, he just had to get this over the short third fielder but the ramp went much squarer, allowing the fine deep backward point fielder to get into the act. Hooda's scratchy innings is cut short.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball.

While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball.

While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball.

Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings.

RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin. His strike rate is 141.17 against slower bowlers, which dips to 75 against wrist spin, with the wicketkeeper batter having managed only 12 off 16.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team.

Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.

Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball.

Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin. His strike rate is 141.17 against slower bowlers, which dips to 75 against wrist spin, with the wicketkeeper batter having managed only 12 off 16.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.

And their respective journeys in this IPL have been similar too. Both started with a loss, both registered a hat-trick of victories and then lost the subsequent game. Now, ahead of the clash at the DY Patil Stadium, both teams have the confidence of another victory to their names as they face off to end the symmetry that they've carried along so far.  RCB's primary concern will be the top order, with skipper Faf du Plessis and former captain Virat Kohli having managed only one fifty-plus score in the 12 innings between them. Du Plessis started off with an innings of 88 against Punjab Kings, which he scored at a strike rate of 154, while Kohli hit 41 not out off 29 in that game. Since then, du Plessis has only managed 66 runs in five innings, at under a run a ball. After RCB's opening game, Kohli's sequence reads: 12, 5, 48, 1, and 12, with an overall strike rate of 101.42 from these five games. While Glenn Maxwell and Dinesh Karthik have masked RCB's problem at the top, they won't mind some runs there. Meanwhile, RCB will be encouraged by the improved showing by Mohammed Siraj in the last game - an economy of 7.75 as well as two wickets - having previously gone for a lot of runs.  For LSG, KL Rahul leading from the front against MI with a ton would have pleased the management, with the three-figure score following a couple of low-scoring outings. Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team.

Marcus Stoinis, having joined the team for their last two games, has looked promising, while Manish Pandey getting amongst the runs in the last game would also be a confidence booster for the team. But they will be slightly worried with their overseas paceman Dushmantha Chameera's tendency to leak runs. He has gone for 12 or more in an over in two games, and LSG will want him to tighten up.  When: Tuesday, April 19, at 19:30 IST  Where: DY Patil Stadium, Mumbai  What to expect:  While teams have preferred to chase in evening games, the last two evening games here were won by teams batting first. RCB experienced that first hand when they went down to CSK while Gujarat Titans defeated Rajasthan Royals by 37 runs in the previous evening game played here. Both times, the team batting second was chasing a big total.  Team watch:  Lucknow Super Giants  Tactics & Matchups:  While Dinesh Karthik has scored at a good rate against pace, with a strike rate of 248.33, he has not been as fluent against spin. His strike rate is 141.17 against slower bowlers, which dips to 75 against wrist spin, with the wicketkeeper batter having managed only 12 off 16. Rajasthan Royals held back an over from Yuzvendra Chahal while Delhi Capitals did the same with Kuldeep Yadav, whose final over was kept until the 20th. LSG could do the same with Ravi Bishnoi.  Probable XI:  KL Rahul (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Manish Pandey, Deepak Hooda, Marcus Stoinis, Ayush Badoni, Krunal Pandya, Jason Holder, Dushmantha Chameera, Avesh Khan, Ravi Bishnoi  Royal Challengers Bangalore   B7$LSG have been the best team in terms of using spin in the middle overs. They have bowled as many as 37 overs of spin in this stage, more than any other team, have the best economy rate (6.08) among all teams while they have also picked the most wickets (10) using spin in the middle overs. However, RCB have Maxwell, who has scored 62 runs off 28 deliveries in his three matches so far and could be the key for the side to negate LSG's spin threat.

Sometimes people don't believe it, but my aim is to do something special for the country.
