Abhishek Sharma rocks back to pull this away, misses it altogether and the off-stump goes for a walk. Maxwell is pumped up as RCB have gotten rid of both the openers in the first over of the run chase itself. Both the openers depart without troubling the scorers.

0.1,"Maxwell to Abhishek Sharma, out Williamson Run Out!! What an unfortunate start to SRH's innings. A short ball outside off and Abhishek Sharma punches it to Shahbaz Ahmed at cover. Calls for a run, and the fielder does well to score a direct-hit at the keeper's end with only one stump to aim at. Williamson's bat is on the line and the line belongs to the umpire. Sunrisers lose their captain on the first ball of the run chase.
