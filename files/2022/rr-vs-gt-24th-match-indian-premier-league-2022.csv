They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each. If RR's pacers strike early as they have so far in the season, then the spin duo will fancy their chance to break into the middle order early.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage.

Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each. If RR's pacers strike early as they have so far in the season, then the spin duo will fancy their chance to break into the middle order early.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals.

Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja.

Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad.

Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each. If RR's pacers strike early as they have so far in the season, then the spin duo will fancy their chance to break into the middle order early.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00.

The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each. If RR's pacers strike early as they have so far in the season, then the spin duo will fancy their chance to break into the middle order early.  Probable XI: Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal/Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson (c & wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Riyan Parag, Ravichandran Ashwin, Jimmy Neesham, Navdeep Saini, Trent Boult, Prasidh Krishna, Yuzvendra Chahal  Gujarat Titans  B7$ Rashid Khan will have a big role to play in containing the dangerous Jos Buttler and later in the order, Shimron Hetmyer - both of who have been among the runs this season. Rashid has a good record against the two dismissing them four times, especially with Buttler averaging just 4.50 against the legspinner.  Probable XI: Rahmanullah Gurbaz/Matthew Wade (wk), Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Hardik Pandya (c), David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Abhinav Manohar, Rashid Khan, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Shami, Darshan Nalkande  Did you know?  - There was seven first innings totals in excess of 170 in the first 11 matches and just two in the ten subsequent matches, both in Brabourne.  - Only Bumrah has taken more wickets than the duo of Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal in the last half-a-decade in the IPL. And in the middle overs, the two spinners sit on top of the wicket charts.  - Hetmyer has the second-highest strike-rate in death overs since IPL 2019 behind AB de Villiers. He strikes at 195.95 with a boundary percentage of 27.3.  What they said:  ""The toss is not in our control. We are learning to adapt our game keeping the dew factor in mind. Both toss and the subsequent dew in the second half of the game is out of our hands,"" Padikkal said.","Preview by Kritika Naidu  The overview:  Little separates Rajasthan Royals and the Gujarat Titans after four games in the 2022 edition. They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each. If RR's pacers strike early as they have so far in the season, then the spin duo will fancy their chance to break into the middle order early.

Rashid has a good record against the two dismissing them four times, especially with Buttler averaging just 4.50 against the legspinner.

Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each. If RR's pacers strike early as they have so far in the season, then the spin duo will fancy their chance to break into the middle order early.

Rashid has a good record against the two dismissing them four times, especially with Buttler averaging just 4.50 against the legspinner.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT.

Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad.

The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals.

Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each. If RR's pacers strike early as they have so far in the season, then the spin duo will fancy their chance to break into the middle order early.  Probable XI: Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal/Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson (c & wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Riyan Parag, Ravichandran Ashwin, Jimmy Neesham, Navdeep Saini, Trent Boult, Prasidh Krishna, Yuzvendra Chahal  Gujarat Titans  B7$ Rashid Khan will have a big role to play in containing the dangerous Jos Buttler and later in the order, Shimron Hetmyer - both of who have been among the runs this season. Rashid has a good record against the two dismissing them four times, especially with Buttler averaging just 4.50 against the legspinner.  Probable XI: Rahmanullah Gurbaz/Matthew Wade (wk), Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Hardik Pandya (c), David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Abhinav Manohar, Rashid Khan, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Shami, Darshan Nalkande  Did you know?  - There was seven first innings totals in excess of 170 in the first 11 matches and just two in the ten subsequent matches, both in Brabourne.  - Only Bumrah has taken more wickets than the duo of Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal in the last half-a-decade in the IPL. And in the middle overs, the two spinners sit on top of the wicket charts.  - Hetmyer has the second-highest strike-rate in death overs since IPL 2019 behind AB de Villiers.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad.

The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals.

The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).

RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.  When: RR vs GT, April 14, 19:30 IST  Where: Dr DY Patil Sports Academy, NaviMumbai  What to expect: The CSK-RCB game was played on a used wicket, with it being so dry that the dust on it was palpable. The spinners played a crucial role in the second innings with 7 wickets shared between Mahesh Theekshana and Ravindra Jadeja. If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage.

Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.

They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far.

If a similar wicket is on offer, both sides have the arsenal to use it to their advantage. The average first innings total has come down from 177 in 11 games in the first week (March 26-April 3) to 163 in 10 in the second week (April 4-11).  Team Watch:  Rajasthan Royals  Tactics & Matchups: Miller has struggled against both Chahal and Ashwin, falling to them thrice each. If RR's pacers strike early as they have so far in the season, then the spin duo will fancy their chance to break into the middle order early.  Probable XI: Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal/Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson (c & wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Riyan Parag, Ravichandran Ashwin, Jimmy Neesham, Navdeep Saini, Trent Boult, Prasidh Krishna, Yuzvendra Chahal  Gujarat Titans  B7$ Rashid Khan will have a big role to play in containing the dangerous Jos Buttler and later in the order, Shimron Hetmyer - both of who have been among the runs this season. Rashid has a good record against the two dismissing them four times, especially with Buttler averaging just 4.50 against the legspinner.  Probable XI: Rahmanullah Gurbaz/Matthew Wade (wk), Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Hardik Pandya (c), David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Abhinav Manohar, Rashid Khan, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Shami, Darshan Nalkande  Did you know?  - There was seven first innings totals in excess of 170 in the first 11 matches and just two in the ten subsequent matches, both in Brabourne.  - Only Bumrah has taken more wickets than the duo of Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal in the last half-a-decade in the IPL. And in the middle overs, the two spinners sit on top of the wicket charts.  - Hetmyer has the second-highest strike-rate in death overs since IPL 2019 behind AB de Villiers. He strikes at 195.95 with a boundary percentage of 27.3.  What they said:  ""The toss is not in our control. We are learning to adapt our game keeping the dew factor in mind. Both toss and the subsequent dew in the second half of the game is out of our hands,"" Padikkal said.","Preview by Kritika Naidu  The overview:  Little separates Rajasthan Royals and the Gujarat Titans after four games in the 2022 edition. They're both tied on 6 points with three wins and a loss. Between both captains, Sanju Samson and Hardik Pandya, they've won just the one toss; RR are yet to chase in the tournament.  But most importantly, both sides' pacers have dominated the powerplay phase this season - with Trent Boult & Prasidh Krishna for RR, Mohammed Shami, Hardik Pandya and Lockie Ferguson for GT. RR's pacers have picked up 8 wickets, averaging 14.25, while GT's have 9 wickets at 17.00. Rashid Khan and Yuzvendra Chahal have been the most successful bowlers in the middle overs since IPL 2017, averaging 20.21 and 20.97 with 70 and 60 wickets respectively.  Gujarat, meanwhile, were handed their first loss of the season after an eight-wicket trouncing at the hands of the Sunrisers Hyderabad. One aspect that has hurt GT has been their opening stand which hasn't survived a powerplay so far. In the four games, their first-wicket stands have been worth: 4, 2, 32 and 24. Left-hander Sai Sudarshan batting at No.3 now provides break in the run of right-handers at the top. Matthew Wade will likely make way for Rahmanullah Gurbaz, considering his inability to get starts so far and factoring in the latter's superior record in Asia. Gurbaz, in 68 innings, has amassed 1620 runs at an average of 24.17, striking at a dangerous 151.82 as opposed to Wade's 93.36. The middle-order too has been needing to get among the runs with David Miller yet to fire.  Samson too has had little success after the first game; it's evident he's struggling when pace is taken off in what has been his slowest start to a season in the last six years. His game has been found wanting on slower tracks in the past, and with tracks set to slow down as the season progress, his form could be a cause of concern for the Royals. Shimron Hetmyer's display of power and skill in the death, though, has done RR a world of good. He's striking at close to 200 and has contributed in all four games so far. Gujarat will want to contain him in the death, with Rashid having the wood over him, but GT may have vital strategic decisions to make as to how Rashid should be used.
