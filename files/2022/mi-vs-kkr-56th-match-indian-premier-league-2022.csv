This went off the toe-end of the bat, after Kartikeya shuffled across the stumps early and got lucky that he wasn't hit on the pad or bowled.

Ashwin knows he can't negotiate it standing still, and so backs away, forcing Cummins to follow him and then opts for the ramp. Not a bad option, except that third man is in place and quite fine too, precisely for this sort of an adventure. Right down to Varun who times his leap well to take a nice overhead catch.

14.4," Cummins to Daniel Sams, out Caught by Jackson!! Double strike from Cummins! Is this the game-defining over? Bumrah bowled at around this point earlier on in the game and deflated KKR completely. It's Cummins' turn now. No compassion for his fellow countryman at all as his bangs this into that hard length, cramping the batter for room as well but Sams decides to slog anyway and gets a huge top-edge that crashes into his helmet and balloons towards Jackson.

14.1," Cummins to Ishan Kishan, out Caught by Rinku Singh!! Cummins with a massive breakthrough! Gee, this game just continues to ebb and flow at blistering pace. That short ball has been of great efficiency on this surface tonight and trust Australia's premier fast bowler to hit that spot with pace. Well-directed bumper and Kishan is forced into an aggressive pull stroke. Huge top-edge and it's another sky-kisser towards fine leg.

13.5," Narine to Pollard, 1 run, Shreyas puts down a blinder! Very tough chance but these are the kind of catches that decide games. Pollard went hard on the back foot pull, hit it well too but couldn't keep it down. KKR's skipper in the ring at mid-wicket reacted sharply, but it burst through his palms.
