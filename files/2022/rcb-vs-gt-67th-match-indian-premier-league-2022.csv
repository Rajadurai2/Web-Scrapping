For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.

Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

On the evidence available, third ump sticks with the onfield call but Wade is livid. Cannot believe. We have seen UltraEdge misbehave this tournament.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.  What they said:  ""He (Kohli) is seeing the lighter side of it, every single way that you can possibly get out, is happening to him. That's how the game works.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings.

When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season.

Simple outswinger, again the length the key. Good length. Shubman Gill plays a lazy defence with zero feet movement. Pokes at it away from the body with hard hands. It was a thick edge flying towards third man, but Maxi was wide of slip and he dived full length to his right to pluck it. RCB had that slip wide, which is why this catch was possible.

Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that.

Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.

Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL.

But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.

Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL.

Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.

Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL.

To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that.

Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.

In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.

The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.

And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.

In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.

Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.

Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.

For those teams sweating it out to rubber-stump a place in the IPL 2022 playoffs, it could also feel like a game of decimal points (NRR). With 14 points to their name, Royal Challengers Bangalore will be aiming to defeat table-toppers Gujarat Titans in their final game of the league phase to give themselves the best chance of progressing to the next phase. But if they lose, it would be an exit door for the franchise as they have a negative NRR of -.323. Even if RCB emerge victorious, they would find themselves on the edge of a precipice as Delhi Capitals are also currently on 14 points and have a positive NRR.  Just like some of the past seasons, RCB have been hit by an inconsistency bug - some promise mixed with red flags. However, to the think tank's credit, they have tried to keep a settled combination, making only six changes so far. They go into the all-important match on the back of a loss against Punjab Kings. To make matters worse, Jonny Bairstow went on a six-hitting spree and their premier fast bowler, Josh Hazlewood ended up with sorry figures of 0 for 64 from four overs. Virat Kohli's poor form and Mohammed Siraj leaking runs continue to be a worry for RCB. In fact, Siraj has conceded 85 runs in his last seven overs in this IPL.  On a positive note, Wanindu Hasaranga has been a shining light for RCB, having bagged 23 wickets so far. The other silver lining is Rajat Patidar making the number three spot his own with useful contributions. Unlike their opponent, GT are flying high, having already secured a berth in Qualifier 1. A couple of losses didn't go according to the script, but GT got their campaign back on track with victories over Chennai Super Kings and Lucknow Super Giants.  Wriddhiman Saha has provided them with the booster in the Powerplay over the last few games while Shubman Gill has compiled over 400 runs this season. As the tournament has progressed, Rashid Khan has taken his game to a different zone, having picked up seven wickets in his last three matches. A few tired decks have played a part in that. In the pace department, Mohammed Shami will be polishing his swing and seam bowling skills to make incisions up front. One of the worry lines for the side is the form of their skipper Hardik Pandya, who has compiled only 56 runs in his last six matches.  When: RCB v GT, Match 67, IPL 2022 at 7.30 pm local  Where: Wankhede stadium, Mumbai  What to expect: The last game played at the Wankhede stadium - SRH versus MI - was a high-scoring match. The decks at the Wankhede have tended to offer spongy bounce through the course of the tournament.  Teams watch:  Royal Challengers Bangalore  Tactics and Matchups: Hasaranga has snared the most wickets in the middle phase in this IPL. And he could again come into play in tomorrow's game, especially in the backdrop of GT's batters slotting in at number 3 and 4 struggling to notch up scores of substance. Hazlewood versus Saha will be another interesting matchup. The 'keeper-batter would hope to disrupt Hazlewood's unremitting discipline with lofts and across the line shots.  Probable XI: Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis (c), Rajat Patidar, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Dinesh Karthik (wk), Shahbaz Ahmed, Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, Mohammed Siraj, Josh Hazlewood.  Gujarat Titans  Tactics and Matchups: On the other hand, GT's seamers have been excellent with the new ball, exemplified by them taking 25 wickets in the PowerPlay this season. Shami alone has scalped 11 wickets in that period. Rashid has dislodged Karthik three times and given away only 30 runs off 28 balls. In the previous fixture between these two sides, one over of Rashid was held back and the champion spinner removed Karthik with the googly. Shami versus Kohli would be another intriguing matchup, with the seamer having dismissed the RCB mainstay five times in IPL. A couple of those dismissals have come in the end overs, with Kohli looking to up the ante.  Probable XI: Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Shubman Gill, Matthew Wade, Hardik Pandya, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Alzarri Joseph, Yash Dayal, Mohammed Shami.  Did you know?   -GT's seamers have the best death overs economy rate (9.62) in IPL 2022.  -RCB and GT are undefeated at the Wankhede this season with both sides winning three matches each.  What they said:  ""He (Kohli) is seeing the lighter side of it, every single way that you can possibly get out, is happening to him. That's how the game works.
