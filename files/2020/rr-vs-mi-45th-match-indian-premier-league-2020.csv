19.6," Kartik Tyagi to Hardik Pandya, SIX, Pandya powers Mumbai to 195/5! Tyagi bowls a full length ball on off and Hardik smokes it over long-off to finish the innings off in style. Insane hitting!

Elimination stares at them if they lose two. And if they win two of three, theoretically, they will still be in with a chance, but with little assurance.  Sunrisers Hyderabad comfortably overcame RR in their last clash despite losing both David Warner and Jonny Bairstow in the first three overs. It was Rajasthan's inability to get a par total in Dubai with runs drying up in the middle overs that really hurt them as the conditions gradually eased up for the batting side in the second innings.. The move of opening with Ben Stokes is not one that has yielded the desired results for RR yet. And a good start is almost imperative against table-toppers Mumbai Indians, who are coming off a ten-wicket trouncing of Chennai Super Kings. How Samson will tackle the left-arm pace of Boult will be a contest to watch out for.  If any team can boast of having almost all bases covered, it is the Mumbai Indians. They even have the luxury of ""resting"" players to ""manage workload"" with their substitutes doing the job just as well. For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on.

Sunrisers Hyderabad comfortably overcame RR in their last clash despite losing both David Warner and Jonny Bairstow in the first three overs.

They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.

The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on.

For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on.

For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.

Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.

Elimination stares at them if they lose two. And if they win two of three, theoretically, they will still be in with a chance, but with little assurance.  Sunrisers Hyderabad comfortably overcame RR in their last clash despite losing both David Warner and Jonny Bairstow in the first three overs. It was Rajasthan's inability to get a par total in Dubai with runs drying up in the middle overs that really hurt them as the conditions gradually eased up for the batting side in the second innings.. The move of opening with Ben Stokes is not one that has yielded the desired results for RR yet.

For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.

They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on.

Probable XI: Ben Stokes, Robin Uthappa, Sanju Samson (wk), Steven Smith (c), Jos Buttler, Riyan Parag, Rahul Tewatia, Jofra Archer, Shreyas Gopal, Ankit Rajpoot, Kartik Tyagi","Preview by Kritika Naidu  Such has been the quicksilver movement in this ongoing season of the Indian Premier League that even wins in their three remaining games will not guarantee Rajasthan Royals a top-four finish. Elimination stares at them if they lose two. And if they win two of three, theoretically, they will still be in with a chance, but with little assurance.  Sunrisers Hyderabad comfortably overcame RR in their last clash despite losing both David Warner and Jonny Bairstow in the first three overs. It was Rajasthan's inability to get a par total in Dubai with runs drying up in the middle overs that really hurt them as the conditions gradually eased up for the batting side in the second innings.. The move of opening with Ben Stokes is not one that has yielded the desired results for RR yet. And a good start is almost imperative against table-toppers Mumbai Indians, who are coming off a ten-wicket trouncing of Chennai Super Kings. How Samson will tackle the left-arm pace of Boult will be a contest to watch out for.  If any team can boast of having almost all bases covered, it is the Mumbai Indians. They even have the luxury of ""resting"" players to ""manage workload"" with their substitutes doing the job just as well. For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on.

Probable XI: Ben Stokes, Robin Uthappa, Sanju Samson (wk), Steven Smith (c), Jos Buttler, Riyan Parag, Rahul Tewatia, Jofra Archer, Shreyas Gopal, Ankit Rajpoot, Kartik Tyagi","Preview by Kritika Naidu  Such has been the quicksilver movement in this ongoing season of the Indian Premier League that even wins in their three remaining games will not guarantee Rajasthan Royals a top-four finish. Elimination stares at them if they lose two. And if they win two of three, theoretically, they will still be in with a chance, but with little assurance.  Sunrisers Hyderabad comfortably overcame RR in their last clash despite losing both David Warner and Jonny Bairstow in the first three overs. It was Rajasthan's inability to get a par total in Dubai with runs drying up in the middle overs that really hurt them as the conditions gradually eased up for the batting side in the second innings.. The move of opening with Ben Stokes is not one that has yielded the desired results for RR yet. And a good start is almost imperative against table-toppers Mumbai Indians, who are coming off a ten-wicket trouncing of Chennai Super Kings. How Samson will tackle the left-arm pace of Boult will be a contest to watch out for.  If any team can boast of having almost all bases covered, it is the Mumbai Indians. They even have the luxury of ""resting"" players to ""manage workload"" with their substitutes doing the job just as well. For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on.

How Samson will tackle the left-arm pace of Boult will be a contest to watch out for.  If any team can boast of having almost all bases covered, it is the Mumbai Indians. They even have the luxury of ""resting"" players to ""manage workload"" with their substitutes doing the job just as well. For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on.

They even have the luxury of ""resting"" players to ""manage workload"" with their substitutes doing the job just as well. For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on.

The move of opening with Ben Stokes is not one that has yielded the desired results for RR yet. And a good start is almost imperative against table-toppers Mumbai Indians, who are coming off a ten-wicket trouncing of Chennai Super Kings. How Samson will tackle the left-arm pace of Boult will be a contest to watch out for.  If any team can boast of having almost all bases covered, it is the Mumbai Indians. They even have the luxury of ""resting"" players to ""manage workload"" with their substitutes doing the job just as well. For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on.

Probable XI: Ben Stokes, Robin Uthappa, Sanju Samson (wk), Steven Smith (c), Jos Buttler, Riyan Parag, Rahul Tewatia, Jofra Archer, Shreyas Gopal, Ankit Rajpoot, Kartik Tyagi","Preview by Kritika Naidu  Such has been the quicksilver movement in this ongoing season of the Indian Premier League that even wins in their three remaining games will not guarantee Rajasthan Royals a top-four finish. Elimination stares at them if they lose two. And if they win two of three, theoretically, they will still be in with a chance, but with little assurance.  Sunrisers Hyderabad comfortably overcame RR in their last clash despite losing both David Warner and Jonny Bairstow in the first three overs. It was Rajasthan's inability to get a par total in Dubai with runs drying up in the middle overs that really hurt them as the conditions gradually eased up for the batting side in the second innings.. The move of opening with Ben Stokes is not one that has yielded the desired results for RR yet. And a good start is almost imperative against table-toppers Mumbai Indians, who are coming off a ten-wicket trouncing of Chennai Super Kings. How Samson will tackle the left-arm pace of Boult will be a contest to watch out for.  If any team can boast of having almost all bases covered, it is the Mumbai Indians. They even have the luxury of ""resting"" players to ""manage workload"" with their substitutes doing the job just as well. For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on.

Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast.

The move of opening with Ben Stokes is not one that has yielded the desired results for RR yet. And a good start is almost imperative against table-toppers Mumbai Indians, who are coming off a ten-wicket trouncing of Chennai Super Kings. How Samson will tackle the left-arm pace of Boult will be a contest to watch out for.  If any team can boast of having almost all bases covered, it is the Mumbai Indians. They even have the luxury of ""resting"" players to ""manage workload"" with their substitutes doing the job just as well. For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on.

Although Tyagi went for a few runs against SRH, it's unlikely they will make a change to their line-up.  Probable XI: Ben Stokes, Robin Uthappa, Sanju Samson (wk), Steven Smith (c), Jos Buttler, Riyan Parag, Rahul Tewatia, Jofra Archer, Shreyas Gopal, Ankit Rajpoot, Kartik Tyagi","Preview by Kritika Naidu  Such has been the quicksilver movement in this ongoing season of the Indian Premier League that even wins in their three remaining games will not guarantee Rajasthan Royals a top-four finish. Elimination stares at them if they lose two. And if they win two of three, theoretically, they will still be in with a chance, but with little assurance.  Sunrisers Hyderabad comfortably overcame RR in their last clash despite losing both David Warner and Jonny Bairstow in the first three overs. It was Rajasthan's inability to get a par total in Dubai with runs drying up in the middle overs that really hurt them as the conditions gradually eased up for the batting side in the second innings.. The move of opening with Ben Stokes is not one that has yielded the desired results for RR yet. And a good start is almost imperative against table-toppers Mumbai Indians, who are coming off a ten-wicket trouncing of Chennai Super Kings. How Samson will tackle the left-arm pace of Boult will be a contest to watch out for.  If any team can boast of having almost all bases covered, it is the Mumbai Indians. They even have the luxury of ""resting"" players to ""manage workload"" with their substitutes doing the job just as well. For instance, Ishan Kishan stepped in seamlessly into the opening slot for Rohit Sharma, who missed out in the clash against CSK owing to a hamstring injury.  They haven't even needed Hardik Pandya to bowl, given how vast their bowling stocks are, with their powerplay bowlers in Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah delivering the early wickets more often than not. Boult in the powerplay overs this year has returned 10 wickets at 16.30, conceding at just 6.79 runs per over.  Rajasthan have had their own powerplay specialist in Jofra Archer, who has picked 7 wickets in 20 overs he's bowled in that phase, conceding just at 4.65. Overall, while he has picked 15 wickets with an economy rate of 6.62, it has been the lack of support from the other end that has cost them in stark contrast. The other seamers collectively have returned 16 wickets, with an ER of 10.29, with Stokes wicketless in his eight overs, but having conceded at 10.25.  While Mumbai already have one foot in the play-offs, it's pretty much do-or-die for Rajasthan here on. While the eventual result may not be in their hand, the least they can do is try and control the controllables.
