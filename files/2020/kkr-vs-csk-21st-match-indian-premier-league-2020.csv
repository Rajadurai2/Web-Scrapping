19.6," Dwayne Bravo to Chakravarthy, out Chakravarthy Run Out!! 1 run completed. Jadeja and Dhoni, goodluck taking risk against this duo. Chakravarthy powers this low full toss to deep mid-wicket and there was never a two there, KKR still run in hope and hope is all that'll remain for them.

19.5,"Dwayne Bravo to Shivam Mavi, out Caught by Dhoni!! Goodness me! That is a spectacular catch from MSD. Sheer commitment and his athleticism was on full display while grabbing the catch. Dhoni seemed to have signalled something to Bravo just before this delivery and I'm guessing it's something to do with lack of pace. Keeps it in the shortish length area does Bravo and induces a thick outside edge on the slog. Dhoni dives full length to his right, juggles it on the first attempt and then takes the rebound with a sharp spring to his right. 150th IPL wicket for Bravo!
