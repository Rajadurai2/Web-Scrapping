10.5,"Chawla to Warner, out Caught by du Plessis!! Faf is making a habit of pulling off these boundary-flirting catches and he makes it look so easy. Warner is disappointed and he knew he was in trouble from the moment it left the bat. Huge wicket for CSK. Warner danced down the track and perhaps got a little too close to the pitch of the delivery, miscues the loft off the toe-end, it did seem like going for a maximum but there's always a risk involved when you take on a fielder like Faf. He Leaps up full length, grabs the ball on the jump and quickly realizes, he's gonna go over the ropes. What does he do then? Just maintains his composure, lobs the ball in the air before going over the ropes and collects the ball with ease on the second attempt.
